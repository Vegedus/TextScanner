[03-08-2014 22:58:15] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: T-minus 2 days before cooking:
-Defrost the pig.

T-minus 1 day before cooking:
-Season the pig with 250g of salt, 100g of garlic and 75g of white pepper.

Cooking day:
-Take that damn pig to the bakery so it can be cooked while still whole because I don't have a damn wooden stove big enough for it.

[04-08-2014 06:57:57] Neko-chan~: you shouldn't use it in a fashion that is not proper. retarded means slow. like if a car is running slowly due to engine problems, the correct term is retarded. now if something is stupid to you, it is not alright to say retard, i believe. but that's me.
[04-08-2014 06:59:26] Neko-chan~: meh i don't like getting into discussions like that. i usually just ignore people who do that. idk i don't get up in arms over things. meh. wasted energy.
[04-08-2014 07:00:01] Artann: If a car is being slow it's retardING
[04-08-2014 07:00:12 | Edited 07:00:17] Artann: not retarded
[04-08-2014 07:00:34 | Edited 07:00:40] Artann: And using retarded is fine. As long as you don't call a mentally handicapped person retarded
[04-08-2014 07:00:35] Neko-chan~: oh yea, wrong tense
[04-08-2014 07:01:01] Neko-chan~: but you get what i am saying yea? there are correct ways to use words and incorrect ways. it's really not okay to use words incorrectly like that.
[04-08-2014 07:01:32 | Edited 07:01:42] Artann: What part of calling someone retarded is incorrect?
[04-08-2014 07:01:39] Neko-chan~: meh like i said, i could care less. i ain't one of those sj freak out people...
[04-08-2014 07:02:17] Neko-chan~: [4. august 2014 07:01] Artan: 

<<< What part of calling someone retarded is incorrect?if you can't tell, i can't explain it. like i said, i could care less lol
[04-08-2014 07:03:00] Artann: Meh, I live in NYC. If you don't have a potty mouth you're basically a pushover
[04-08-2014 07:03:37] Neko-chan~: <- total pushover, everyone knows it
[04-08-2014 07:04:29] Artann: I've sorta am trying to stop saying faggot but it's incredibly difficult when you have a little brother
[04-08-2014 07:04:39] Artann: like it's just instinctive to call him that when he's being so annoying
[04-08-2014 07:04:43] Artann: I'm fine with fag though
[04-08-2014 07:04:50] Artann: only cause even my gay friends say fag
[04-08-2014 07:06:37] Artann: Also cunt seems to be an issue?
[04-08-2014 07:06:43] Artann: I dont understand why
[04-08-2014 07:07:13] Neko-chan~: i don't mind cunt
[04-08-2014 07:07:41] Neko-chan~: i am not comfortable with people using fag/faggot or retarded incorrectly but i don't fight people about it. but nothing about cunt seems offensive.
[04-08-2014 07:08:02 | Edited 07:08:09] Neko-chan~: its a part of a woman's body. the cunt. i've been called a cunt and could never care less.
[04-08-2014 07:08:09] Artann: how do you use faggot correctly?
[04-08-2014 07:09:31 | Edited 07:09:43] Neko-chan~: ehhh i mean, it does mean a pile of sticks. but nah i just lumped my sentences together by accident. i meant like using retarded incorrectly or using faggot in general. me and my bad communication skills haha they'll be the death of me
[04-08-2014 07:11:12] rengishi: If someone is being a nuisance
[04-08-2014 07:11:18] rengishi: I call em a fag
[04-08-2014 07:11:26] rengishi: Tis the term
[04-08-2014 07:11:27] Artann: Why don't more people call others garbage?
[04-08-2014 07:11:28] rengishi: Also
[04-08-2014 07:11:33] Artann: I think it's the funniest thing ever
[04-08-2014 07:11:41 | Edited 07:11:48] Neko-chan~: lol garbage is a good insult
[04-08-2014 07:11:42] rengishi: Retard literally also defines as stupid
[04-08-2014 07:11:55] Artann: "YAH GARBAGE! You'll never been anything more garbage"
[04-08-2014 07:12:01] rengishi: So, it is applicable
[04-08-2014 07:12:03] Neko-chan~: [4. august 2014 07:11] Spider  Tiki: 

<<< Retard literally also defines as stupidwhere does it define as that? no where i have seen

[04-08-2014 07:13:39] Neko-chan~: i wouldn't trust that definition, spidey lol retarded means very literally slowed
[04-08-2014 07:14:03] Neko-chan~: but hey hey guys like i said
[04-08-2014 07:14:12] Neko-chan~: i don't care hahaha don't got the energy
[04-08-2014 07:14:21] rengishi: Alot of terms that USED to be the name for something are offensive and theres like a billion and one terms and just fuck all of that shit man
[04-08-2014 07:14:26] Artann: Why wouldnt you trust it
[04-08-2014 07:14:30] Artann: its from dictionary . com

[04-08-2014 07:28:39] Neko-chan~: it's the only part of me i really like honestly. i have low self esteem and don't really like most of me but damn am i proud of my butt. i get defensive about my best butt title for this reason lol
[04-08-2014 07:29:03] Artann: I like my dick a lot
[04-08-2014 07:29:09] Artann: I think I've got a handsome dick
[04-08-2014 07:29:16] Artann: Coincedentally
[04-08-2014 07:29:20] Artann: I am also a handsome dick

[04-08-2014 17:04:05] Spider Tiki:   Tis sad I never got to see
[04-08-2014 17:24:58] Spider Tiki: (In reference to butts that haru posted)
[04-08-2014 20:24:22] Neko-chan~: you didn't? aww... that's sad
[04-08-2014 20:24:27] Neko-chan~: it was great
[04-08-2014 20:24:48 | Edited 20:24:52] Neko-chan~: it was replied with "daaamns" and thumbs ups
[04-08-2014 20:26:53] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: It's a pretty good butt
[04-08-2014 22:14:28] Spider Tiki: Welp, such is life
[04-08-2014 22:14:46] Spider Tiki: Has snafu been better lately?
[04-08-2014 22:14:53] Spider Tiki: Id have to assume so
[04-08-2014 22:18:27] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Nope
[04-08-2014 22:18:36] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Boring as hell
[04-08-2014 22:20:08] Spider Tiki: I meant not full of itself
[04-08-2014 22:21:03] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: That too
[04-08-2014 22:21:05] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Nope
[04-08-2014 22:21:14] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Still full of itself
[04-08-2014 22:21:24] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Feel like it's deteriorating
[04-08-2014 22:23:48] Neko-chan~: it is
[04-08-2014 22:23:52] Neko-chan~: has been for awhile
[04-08-2014 22:25:26] Spider Tiki: We all know why
[04-08-2014 22:25:51] Spider Tiki: I mean, I was around in 06, and it was no wonderland then either
[04-08-2014 22:26:15] Spider Tiki: But at least then it wasnt biased towards a specific group
[04-08-2014 22:26:39] Spider Tiki: Notmto mention its a comic site with no real new comics coming in anymore?
[04-08-2014 22:28:05] Neko-chan~: i joined in 08 and it was a bit more nonchalant i would say
[04-08-2014 22:28:40] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Not even a 'comics' site
[04-08-2014 22:28:48] Neko-chan~: no more comics, now it's a community that has taken a life of it's own, like... it's it's own little world i would say
[04-08-2014 22:28:50] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: More like a Bleedman official site
[04-08-2014 22:29:02] Neko-chan~: and even then, most people have given up on bleed's work
[04-08-2014 22:29:34] Neko-chan~: everyone seems to either leave or eventually come to spam (or lit or art, those places are their own thing too just not as active as spam)
[04-08-2014 22:32:57] Spider Tiki: Yep, to be real
[04-08-2014 22:33:18] Neko-chan~: i'm coming back soon
[04-08-2014 22:33:25] Spider Tiki: Snafu is dead, it died between 12 and 13, what I look at and see now is a zombie
[04-08-2014 22:33:33] Neko-chan~: truuue
[04-08-2014 22:34:09] Neko-chan~: with a hierarchey and an ignored people's voice... in my opinion...
[04-08-2014 22:34:44] Vegedus-dono~: Oh you people.
[04-08-2014 22:34:54] Neko-chan~: ehh it's venting
[04-08-2014 22:35:00] Neko-chan~: no harm, no foul
[04-08-2014 22:35:00] Vegedus-dono~: People have been saying snafu is dead for the past 5 years, at least
[04-08-2014 22:35:31] Vegedus-dono~: And every newbie to come along declares it dead once they've been there for a year or two.
[04-08-2014 22:35:38] Vegedus-dono~: Or three.
[04-08-2014 22:35:39] Neko-chan~: i've been here for 6
[04-08-2014 22:35:45] Spider Tiki: I was there since 06
[04-08-2014 22:35:55] Neko-chan~: and i've been saying it's been dead since like 2011
[04-08-2014 22:36:04] Vegedus-dono~: So the math fits.
[04-08-2014 22:36:10] Vegedus-dono~: AND YET IT'S STILL THERE
[04-08-2014 22:36:15] Neko-chan~: yup
[04-08-2014 22:36:23] Neko-chan~: it's like in a hospital bed, just clinging to life
[04-08-2014 22:37:03] Vegedus-dono~: It's not dead. It's in steady decline and in worse shape than it was in it's hayday. Since it's continually going downhill "hayday" is whenever one joined.
[04-08-2014 22:37:15] Vegedus-dono~: And yet, there's still activity, and will be for a loooong while longer.
[04-08-2014 22:37:25] Neko-chan~: yup
[04-08-2014 22:37:33] Neko-chan~: no one is disagreeing veggie lol
[04-08-2014 22:37:59] Neko-chan~: honestly snafu reminds me of the local mall around here
[04-08-2014 22:38:05] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah, well, you're using "dead" wrong then.
[04-08-2014 22:38:17] Neko-chan~: people have been saying it's in debt and going under for like 10 years
[04-08-2014 22:38:20] Vegedus-dono~: People have been declaring pc gaming dead for 10 years too.
[04-08-2014 22:38:23] Neko-chan~: and it still stands lol
[04-08-2014 22:38:28] Spider Tiki: The old snafu is dead, the good one is dead
[04-08-2014 22:38:43] Spider Tiki: Pc gam7ng is thriving and well
[04-08-2014 22:38:57] Neko-chan~: meh snafu was never really all that good even in it's hayday
[04-08-2014 22:39:20 | Edited 22:39:52] Neko-chan~: it's kind of always been a bit crappy but at least is was kind of chill... meh
[04-08-2014 22:39:53] Spider Tiki: I never said it was
[04-08-2014 22:40:07] Spider Tiki: Just that it is nowhere near as good now
[04-08-2014 22:40:44] Neko-chan~: um yea? "the good one" lol idk i guess i've never thought it was really all nice or anything
[04-08-2014 22:41:17] Neko-chan~: ah well, though, i've been there for 6 years, joined before even my bullies, and i'll be there for many years because i doubt snafu will be going down anytime soon
[04-08-2014 22:43:11] Vegedus-dono~: How active have you been those years? I don't even remember seeing your name until, like, 3 years ago, maybe
[04-08-2014 22:43:22] Vegedus-dono~: Could have just been in the PPGD forum I suppose...
[04-08-2014 22:43:52] Neko-chan~: yea i didn't go to spam much
[04-08-2014 22:44:13] Neko-chan~: i was active for like the first 2 years a great deal but i wasn't p[art of the spam crowd so i was overlooked
[04-08-2014 22:44:16] Vegedus-dono~: RPs always been my main hangout.
[04-08-2014 22:44:26] Neko-chan~: then i went left for like a year cause i was focused on school
[04-08-2014 22:46:27] Spider Tiki: I remember haru from like 08
[04-08-2014 22:46:31] Spider Tiki: At best
[04-08-2014 22:46:35] Neko-chan~: then i came back... kind of pisses me off when people say they only noticed me like the past 6 months but that's only cause that's when i discovered snafu was on skype. had no idea and nobody told me for the fucking longest time so it was devasting. i swear a good lot of people on snafu only notice you if you are from skype. that's why fummo made me cry when he said i wasn't close like everyone else, because fuck, i didn't know i had to magically find out everyone was on skype and it was the only way to become noticable.
[04-08-2014 22:46:40] Spider Tiki: But I joined at 11 as a troll
[04-08-2014 22:46:50] Neko-chan~: i did lurk a lot too
[04-08-2014 22:48:53] Spider Tiki: Anyone listen to the brobecks?
[04-08-2014 22:51:08 | Edited 22:51:24] Vegedus-dono~: Welp, Rapscallions got started due to Carrionman and was just steadily expanded. It was Stuff's whims that decided how it grew and who got invited. It had already existed for like half a year before someone thought to invite me, and I was 'known'. Which is also why there were so many alternative chats created.

There were skyping before that, in a more loose format, but I honestly forget how it got started. Maybe it was Devnator & Asmodai? Who invited me, because they'd been in one of my RPs.
[04-08-2014 22:51:43] Neko-chan~: millo pushes it in my face that this place is some rip off of Raps
[04-08-2014 22:51:46] Neko-chan~: but like
[04-08-2014 22:52:02] Neko-chan~: raps is just some little friend group, it was blatantly said not to be official
[04-08-2014 22:52:09] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah.
[04-08-2014 22:52:20] Neko-chan~: so fuck if i got kicked out, it makes sense i made my own to be able to talk to my friends, all of you
[04-08-2014 22:52:55] Vegedus-dono~: Rapscallions isn't THE snafu chat, just the most active. It's an coincidence that it has the signifigance it has in the community.
[04-08-2014 22:52:57] Neko-chan~: thing is he left raps but then stuff wanted him back so he went back. fucking hilarious.
[04-08-2014 22:53:12] Neko-chan~: well mine is just as active, it's become just as popular.
[04-08-2014 22:53:24] Vegedus-dono~: Well, how would you know :P?
[04-08-2014 22:53:37] Neko-chan~: i just do
[04-08-2014 22:53:48] Vegedus-dono~: That sounds... Conceited.
[04-08-2014 22:53:58] Neko-chan~: i've been hearing that it is declining... which is why stuff probably asked millo to come back. cause she's losing it.
[04-08-2014 22:54:07 | Edited 22:54:12] Neko-chan~: and meh, i'm only human...
[04-08-2014 22:54:22] Vegedus-dono~: There was like a 1000 messages today :/
[04-08-2014 22:54:28] Neko-chan~: lol kay
[04-08-2014 22:54:35] Neko-chan~: i'm kind of in a bad state right now
[04-08-2014 22:54:39] Neko-chan~: crying...
[04-08-2014 22:54:50] Vegedus-dono~: Some people freak out if there's a day of inactivity, and it happens, but it doesn't mean anything
[04-08-2014 22:54:54] Vegedus-dono~: :/
[04-08-2014 22:55:21 | Edited 22:55:33] Neko-chan~: nah it's been declining, supposedly it's only like 4 people, which is pretty much same as here lol we are just as active and strong
[04-08-2014 22:55:49] Neko-chan~: go little devils, i am so grateful for this haven
[04-08-2014 22:57:23] Spider Tiki: I kinda wanna start doin hat stuff on snafu again
[04-08-2014 22:57:31] Neko-chan~: idk what that means

[05-08-2014 00:01:31] Neko-chan~: it sucks that i can no longer play that game
[05-08-2014 00:01:42] Neko-chan~: the friend whose wii i played on is no longer a friend
[05-08-2014 00:01:42] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: truly a shame

[07-08-2014 05:27:22] Neko-chan~: good boy, i wish you luck~
[07-08-2014 22:58:24 | Edited 22:58:30] Neko-chan~: guuuuys you wouldn't believe the shitty thing that happened to me last night
[07-08-2014 23:09:02] Spider Tiki: I bet I would
[07-08-2014 23:09:17] Spider Tiki: Im pretty stupid
[07-08-2014 23:10:46 | Edited 23:10:54] Neko-chan~: 1) you aren't stupid, dearie and 2) god it make me sick to my stomach and sobbing, it was really awful
[07-08-2014 23:13:00] Vegedus-dono~: Well, if you wanna tell the story, tell it. Don't force the man to drag it out of you.
[07-08-2014 23:30:41] Neko-chan~: oh sorry, had to go help in the kitchen
[07-08-2014 23:32:22] Neko-chan~: well... i have been trying to stay friends with my ex. and last night, at about midnight, we went to walmart, picking up some snacks. and i ran into my old fuck buddy. who kind of fell in love with me and was unrequainted. and they nearly fought each other while i cried in the car. and was horribly nauseous. i really just wanted to run away. god, it was such a terrible situation.
[07-08-2014 23:44:07 | Edited 23:44:11] Neko-chan~: like duuude i have such bad luck :c
[07-08-2014 23:46:36] Vegedus-dono~: Shit, yeah, that sucks.
[07-08-2014 23:46:57] Vegedus-dono~: Males, am I right?
[07-08-2014 23:47:08] Neko-chan~: word lol
[07-08-2014 23:48:04] Neko-chan~: i have the worst relationships with men, they either want to force a relationship with me, fuck me (rarely anyone *i* want to fuck), or use me.... yup what luck i have
[07-08-2014 23:48:16] Vegedus-dono~: Oh, wait, you mean "unrequited", not unrequainted? That would make more sense.
[07-08-2014 23:48:32] Neko-chan~: did i typo? sorry yea that's what i meant
[07-08-2014 23:49:35] Vegedus-dono~: I have at most one of those problems, I think
[07-08-2014 23:50:22] Neko-chan~: ah? would you like to talk about it, dear?
[07-08-2014 23:50:44] Vegedus-dono~: Nah. It's the least serious of them.
[07-08-2014 23:50:57] Neko-chan~: ah i see
[07-08-2014 23:51:43] Vegedus-dono~: Some women want to fuck me that I don't want to fuck! So I shoo them and they go away! My life is soooo hard!
[07-08-2014 23:51:54] Vegedus-dono~: But I could imagine your suitors being more persistent.
[07-08-2014 23:52:18] Neko-chan~: yea i have that problem but it's more than that, i've been sexually harassed
[07-08-2014 23:52:31] Neko-chan~: like guys touching my butt without permission or pushing themselves onto me
[07-08-2014 23:53:04] Neko-chan~: and that's just not okay, it makes me really uncomofortable and afraid
[07-08-2014 23:53:39] Vegedus-dono~: Most def.
[07-08-2014 23:55:32] Vegedus-dono~: I'm a feminist, so I'll automatically point the finger at the male gender.
[07-08-2014 23:55:35] Vegedus-dono~: (or something)
[07-08-2014 23:56:06] Neko-chan~: lol what?
[07-08-2014 23:56:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: that's at least 50% of the job
[07-08-2014 23:56:57] Vegedus-dono~: Ah, right on cue. Must have summoned you, my anti-thesis.
[07-08-2014 23:57:29] Vegedus-dono~: And that was a joke, for the record, before it's put on your tumblr or something.
[07-08-2014 23:58:02 | Edited 23:59:07] Neko-chan~: i got it, hopefully everyone else did
[07-08-2014 23:58:38] Neko-chan~: but yea it's just i seem to attract certain types of guys who touch me without permission and try to force things on me and that's never okay, no no
[08-08-2014 00:00:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'LL TOUCH YOU WITHOUT PERMISSION
[08-08-2014 00:00:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Like, pick you up or give you a bear hug.
[08-08-2014 00:00:51] Neko-chan~: oh well you definitely have permission to do that
[08-08-2014 00:01:01] Neko-chan~: i love being picked up, it makes me really happy haha
[08-08-2014 00:01:14] Vegedus-dono~: But you're also friends.
[08-08-2014 00:01:21] Vegedus-dono~: Hugging strangers, not even once!
[08-08-2014 00:01:29] Vegedus-dono~: Hug inflation sucks too!
[08-08-2014 00:02:01] Neko-chan~: hmm? o.o
[08-08-2014 00:02:51] Vegedus-dono~: If you hug everyone and everything, you devalue the hug!
[08-08-2014 00:03:07] Neko-chan~: hmm but i like hugging people, it just depends on the person
[08-08-2014 00:03:51] Vegedus-dono~: I don't like hugging people I see as acquaintances rather than friends, it's weird.
[08-08-2014 00:04:06 | Edited 00:04:26] Vegedus-dono~: But I hug my truest bros (m/f) with righteous passion!
[08-08-2014 00:04:32] Neko-chan~: would you hug me? c:
[08-08-2014 00:04:44] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: he said TRUEST
[08-08-2014 00:05:15] Vegedus-dono~: Well, slightly true bros (m/f) still get hugs, just not with the FIERY PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS
[08-08-2014 00:06:10] Neko-chan~: welp i just haven't gotten to bond with veggie but veggie is just the chillest
[08-08-2014 00:09:45] Vegedus-dono~: [8. august 2014 00:04] Neko-chan~: 

<<< would you hug me? c:Hrmm. Good question. If you wanted, I would give a pity hug. But in my view, we're not quuuuiiiite there. But getting closer.
[08-08-2014 00:10:06 | Edited 00:10:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'd get a hug
[08-08-2014 00:10:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: AND DON'T YOU DENY IT
[08-08-2014 00:10:34] Neko-chan~: lol it's okay, i'm enjoying getting closer over time veggie
[08-08-2014 00:10:44] Neko-chan~: hiryu, EVERYONE would give you a hug

[08-08-2014 00:16:38] Vegedus-dono~: And haaaaarh, I'll take that as an arguement
[08-08-2014 00:18:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Would you have prefered if I had said Hakan or Hugo?
[08-08-2014 00:18:40] Vegedus-dono~: Wait, brain fart.
[08-08-2014 00:18:42] Vegedus-dono~: *compliment
[08-08-2014 00:18:52] Neko-chan~: haha
[08-08-2014 00:18:57] Vegedus-dono~: I'll take that as a compliment.
[08-08-2014 00:19:10] Vegedus-dono~: Also following a thread on Snafu, getting thoughts mixed up!
[08-08-2014 00:19:59] Neko-chan~: which thread?
[08-08-2014 00:20:41] Vegedus-dono~: Dark Soulsh
[08-08-2014 00:20:44] Vegedus-dono~: Gaming forum.
[08-08-2014 00:28:43] Neko-chan~: ah i see
[08-08-2014 00:29:52] Neko-chan~: i love my new short hair, i swear guys, i look like a badass killer female video game character - someone give me guns and knives yo
[08-08-2014 00:30:10] Vegedus-dono~: I know photoshop!
[08-08-2014 00:30:18] Vegedus-dono~: ... But can't be bothered.
[08-08-2014 00:31:48] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I dunno
[08-08-2014 00:32:02] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Poison, Chun-Li and Cammy have long hair
[08-08-2014 00:32:07] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and they're pretty badass
[08-08-2014 00:32:22] Neko-chan~: yea but lots of badass female chicks have short hair
[08-08-2014 00:32:27] Neko-chan~: like they look so lethal
[08-08-2014 00:32:39] Vegedus-dono~: I get the logic.
[08-08-2014 00:33:07] Neko-chan~: logic? idk i just like short hair
[08-08-2014 00:33:29] Vegedus-dono~: The logic that it's more practical, more suited for battle.
[08-08-2014 00:33:44] Neko-chan~: i don't look good in long hair sooo short hair all the way
[08-08-2014 00:33:47] Vegedus-dono~: In a fight to the death, yeah, you'd just yank Cammy's ponytail.
[08-08-2014 00:33:49] Neko-chan~: ah true true
[08-08-2014 00:34:17] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: didn't that actually happen in the anime movie?
[08-08-2014 00:34:43] Vegedus-dono~: Can't say I've watched it.
[08-08-2014 00:35:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

[08-08-2014 00:35:27] Vegedus-dono~: Dude, YOU'RE the street fighter freak.
[08-08-2014 00:35:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: plus, the whole fight between Chun-Li and Vega is beautiful
[08-08-2014 00:35:46] Vegedus-dono~: I'm just the guy who suck at fighting games, but likes Guile's Theme, remember?
[08-08-2014 00:36:01] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
[08-08-2014 00:36:48] Vegedus-dono~: PRACTICE IS BORING IF THE LEARNING CURVE IS BORKED
[08-08-2014 00:37:20] Vegedus-dono~: Which movie anyway?
[08-08-2014 00:37:37] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Street Fighter 2: The Movie
[08-08-2014 00:37:46] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Street Fighter Alpha: The Movie was kinda bad
[08-08-2014 00:37:57] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: but the third movie which I can't remember the name... It was decent
[08-08-2014 00:37:59] Vegedus-dono~: The IV one is apparently on youtube in full
[08-08-2014 00:39:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: that's hardly a movie
[08-08-2014 00:40:00] Vegedus-dono~: Neither are you!
[08-08-2014 00:40:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: of course not

[08-08-2014 03:30:24] Neko-chan~: maybe i didn't notice it, i really just button mash

[08-08-2014 03:49:00] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it gives an increase of 30% to all weapons

[14-08-2014 01:11:11] rengishi: Im talking 10-11
[14-08-2014 01:11:58] rengishi: And exo I started that in 6th, only because my middle school gave us take home laptops
[14-08-2014 01:12:24] rengishi: Its how I found snafu
[14-08-2014 01:13:14] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Welp, I had an ipod touch that time
[14-08-2014 01:13:26] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Who knew so much could fit in that little device...
[14-08-2014 01:13:59] rengishi: Pause
[14-08-2014 01:14:20] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Pause?
[14-08-2014 01:14:52] Neko-chan~: i started that when i was 12... on a good ol windows XP desktop
[14-08-2014 01:15:35] rengishi: Pause is for things that either sound gay, or in my place, sexual
[14-08-2014 01:16:09] Neko-chan~: uh you don't wanna discuss sexual things?
[14-08-2014 01:16:16] Neko-chan~: that's cool that's cool
[14-08-2014 01:16:45] rengishi: No, just sounded funny, so I said pause, its like thats what she said
[14-08-2014 01:16:55] rengishi: Anyway
[14-08-2014 01:17:16] rengishi: When I was 10 I shot up and changes started
[14-08-2014 01:17:37] Neko-chan~: oh my~
[14-08-2014 01:17:50] Neko-chan~: i didn't even get proper boobs til i was like 15
[14-08-2014 01:17:56] Neko-chan~: and even now, they are tiny
[14-08-2014 01:19:45] Artan: I remember the first timw wanking
[14-08-2014 01:19:55] Artan: I had no idea what that stuff that came out of my pee hole was
[14-08-2014 01:20:29] rengishi: I did it more just to see what the talk about it was
[14-08-2014 01:21:06] rengishi: First time was weird, then I became obsessed with sexual stuff n porn till I started art
[14-08-2014 01:22:52] Neko-chan~: i did know quite how to go about it and me "cumming" then does not even compare to what i can do now. i have learned lol but i remember feeling very embarassed and guilty back then haha
[14-08-2014 01:23:53] Neko-chan~: i became a little obsessed with porn and sexual stuff myself. til i lost my virginity and now i am sexual only for the kicks and cause i'm used to the persona lol
[14-08-2014 01:25:04] rengishi: Sex made me worse, then I developed the ability to turn my libido on or off at will
[14-08-2014 01:26:41] Neko-chan~: i guess actually doing the deed made the hype die down in my brain. like i like it but it ain't the greatest thing in the world. it's good, though, very good.
[14-08-2014 01:37:08] Artan: It's great and I'm great at it!

[14-08-2014 01:40:31] Neko-chan~: also razor bumps are just blehh so irritating
[14-08-2014 01:40:57] Artan: I'm a hairy fellah so I have to put out like an hour and a half to fix shit up down there

[14-08-2014 02:18:52] rengishi: Worst part about puberty is pimples n zits in weird and uncomfortable places
[14-08-2014 02:19:01] Neko-chan~: yesss

[14-08-2014 02:53:12] Neko-chan~: nice, getting a little trimmed off?
[14-08-2014 02:53:23] rengishi: But partially sick is fine
[14-08-2014 02:53:35] rengishi: Just not completely
[14-08-2014 02:54:03] Artan: Yeah my head is all fluffy now\
[14-08-2014 02:54:30] Artan: Although it'll probably allgrow back before school starts up again
[14-08-2014 03:00:34] Artan: I was thinking of maybe getting a buzz cut but I want people at my new classes to like me
[14-08-2014 03:01:00] Neko-chan~: hmm it doesn't even seem too long right now
[14-08-2014 03:01:18] Artan: You haven't seen it lately duh

[14-08-2014 03:03:19] Artan: Have Nathan Fillion play his character IRL
[14-08-2014 03:05:14] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: the only good thing about Halo
[14-08-2014 03:05:22] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: is the theme of Halo 2 cause it has Steve Vai on the guitar

[14-08-2014 03:09:20] Artan: I say some pretty personal shit
[14-08-2014 03:09:29] Neko-chan~: my sister is not into this stuff, she's a "cool kid"
[14-08-2014 03:10:14] Neko-chan~: yea having family on here would just be uncomfortable
[14-08-2014 03:10:15] Neko-chan~: or anyone i would know in real life
[14-08-2014 03:10:17] Neko-chan~: snafu is like another world
[14-08-2014 03:32:27] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Lol my brother would act like a troll there... probably. Or just find everyone there sad saps and fools.

[14-08-2014 07:42:04] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: -shrug-
[14-08-2014 07:43:05] Rezby: also exodis, this is about 6 hours late to the convo, but I was the same age myself
[14-08-2014 07:43:21] Rezby: but my middle school also had take home laptops, like spider tiki, which is actually also how I found snafu
[14-08-2014 07:43:30] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Well shit
[14-08-2014 07:43:39] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: You kids and your damn take-home laptops
[14-08-2014 07:43:51 | Edited 07:43:58] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I DIDN'T GET ONE, I HAD TO USE MAH HOME COMPUTER
[14-08-2014 07:44:10] Rezby: I mean, I did that too because the take home laptop had all the porn sites blocked and I didnt know about proxies then
[14-08-2014 07:44:17] Rezby: but then I got mine all full of viruses
[14-08-2014 07:44:37] Rezby: because remember, this was an XP in like 2006 or 2008
[14-08-2014 07:44:52] Rezby: thats the age of the virus inducing porn sites
[14-08-2014 07:45:03] Neko-chan~: we didn't have take home ones either, you guys had trusting schools
[14-08-2014 07:45:14] Rezby: I had a rich ass middle school
[14-08-2014 07:45:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I had a ghetto-ass school
[14-08-2014 07:45:47] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Bastards
[14-08-2014 07:46:09] Rezby: eh, there are downsides to going to a super rich school
[14-08-2014 07:46:17] Rezby: but thats more on the parent/caretaker side than the student side
[14-08-2014 07:46:26] Neko-chan~: i went to a hella ghetto middle school
[14-08-2014 07:47:06] Rezby: my gf's fam was forced to move during the middle of the school year and the school all but kicked the students out and did everything in its power to make the parents have a living hell getting the kids to and from school, because they wanted to make the kids transfer since they now lived closer to a different school
[14-08-2014 07:47:40] Rezby: canceled the taxi service, didnt allow the parents to drop the kids off early or late
[14-08-2014 07:47:58] Rezby: gave em hell if they picked em up late
[14-08-2014 07:48:19] Rezby: the school's rich and all, but the administration is nasty as all fuck
[14-08-2014 07:49:29] Rezby: (she has 5 younger siblings, 3 of which went to the school distract at the time, kindergartener, 1st grader, and a 6th grader, all of which started school at a different time of day forcing their dad to just sit in the car with them until the last one's day began)
[14-08-2014 07:49:35] Rezby: this was the previous school year
[14-08-2014 07:49:52] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Woof, that's a bloody hassle
[14-08-2014 07:57:51] Rezby: It was completely horseshit unnecessary, and v frustrating to deal with. I helped out, driving the kids back home after school for the last couple weeks since I finished spring semester and had time off
[14-08-2014 07:58:16] Rezby: But really, it all coulda been avoided if the admins weren't assholes
[14-08-2014 08:01:40] Rezby: But still, it was a nice enough school when I was a young student there myself
[14-08-2014 08:02:13] Rezby: I started kindergarten there like 16 years ago
[14-08-2014 08:03:19] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Damn, that's interesting
[14-08-2014 08:08:22] Artan: do you guys know what a WASP is, cause i have no idea
[14-08-2014 08:08:42 | Edited 08:08:50] Neko-chan~: the bee? or is that an acronym
[14-08-2014 08:08:53] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Lolnope
[14-08-2014 08:09:42] Rezby: White Anglo Saxon protest on?
[14-08-2014 08:09:53] Rezby: Protestant*
[14-08-2014 08:10:24] Rezby: It's also a common nickname given to flying or floating things that have weapons
[14-08-2014 08:10:32] Rezby: Or just weapons
[14-08-2014 19:46:41] rengishi: I had a rich ass virginian school
[14-08-2014 19:46:57] Artan: I got a hair cutt
[14-08-2014 21:32:01] Artan: Hey uh exodis I was wondering if anything ever happened with that chick of yours
[14-08-2014 21:33:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Who?
[14-08-2014 21:34:08] Artan: the one that you were unsure if you wanted to tell her your feelings
[14-08-2014 21:34:39] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Eh
[14-08-2014 21:34:57] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: She's gonna break up with her girlfriend soon. She feels it nearing.
[14-08-2014 21:35:36] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: However, she and a friend of mines are unofficial at the moment. He and she have been together for about 2-3 weeks now.
[14-08-2014 21:35:49] Artan: ouch i feel bad for her girlfriend
[14-08-2014 21:35:58] Artan: you gotta steer clear of girls like that
[14-08-2014 21:38:23] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Nah, she and her have been together for 2 years now. My friend wanted to break up with her for a while now anyway.
Still, I do feel she jumped on another boat quicker than expected.
[14-08-2014 21:38:31] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: -shrug- Her life, I guess.
[14-08-2014 21:43:05] Artan: :0/ sorry it didn't work out
[14-08-2014 21:44:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I'm fine with it anyway!
[14-08-2014 21:44:25] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Was in sort-of a denial phase but I let it sink in.
[14-08-2014 21:44:40] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Besides, she even told me she would never want to lose me.
[14-08-2014 21:59:36] Artan: Well I'm glad then
[14-08-2014 22:00:03] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yep
[14-08-2014 22:00:39] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Eh, we've known each other since last November. Neither one of us don't want nothin' to effect our friendship.

[24-08-2014 18:51:50] Artan: Also Hiryu the last episode for Walking Dead season two comes out tomorrow. So it might be a good time to start the game
[24-08-2014 23:42:10] Rezby: After a few days of moving into the dormitories on campus, I've finally got my room arranged to my satisfaction, and I've opened my laptop for the first time in the better half of a week. What've you all been up to?
[25-08-2014 00:23:57 | Edited 00:30:14] Artan: Getting ready for skool
[25-08-2014 00:29:52] Rezby: yep
[25-08-2014 00:30:03] Rezby: it begins tomorrow
[25-08-2014 00:30:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: AH
[25-08-2014 00:30:36] Artan: It was more of an answer than a question but cool anyways lol
[25-08-2014 00:30:43] Artan: I don't start school till Thursday
[25-08-2014 00:30:56] Artan: Which is silly considering most students don't have weekend classes so it's only 2 days
[25-08-2014 00:31:26] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: school only starts in 3 weeks here
[25-08-2014 00:31:47] Artan: Do you still go Hiryu?
[25-08-2014 00:32:03] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Haven't been to a school in 4 years
[25-08-2014 00:32:14] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: working force, brah
[25-08-2014 00:32:28] Artan: Right riight, no wonder i never see you mention it
[25-08-2014 00:34:39] Rezby: oh, lol, I thought the / was a typo for a ?, my bad
[25-08-2014 00:35:21] Artan: nah its okay i should have fixed it sooner
[25-08-2014 00:35:37] Rezby: that's p weird tho, that your school starts on a thursday. is it just administrative bullshit or is there a real reason?
[25-08-2014 00:37:06] Artan: I honestly have no idea
[25-08-2014 00:38:14] Rezby: lol, at least you got more days off then
[25-08-2014 00:38:31] Artan: Eh to be honest I wouldn't mind
[25-08-2014 00:38:59] Artan: It'd be nice to go to school again
[25-08-2014 00:40:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: says you
[25-08-2014 00:41:05] Rezby: classes can be fun and interesting, but sometimes a lot of it just drags or feels like useless crap
[25-08-2014 00:41:35] Artan: Yeah but at least in college you gain the freedom of choosing classes you might enjoy
[25-08-2014 00:41:42] Artan: After Prerequisstes andall
[25-08-2014 00:42:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: [25. august 2014 00:41] Artan: 

<<< Yeah but at least in college you gain the freedom of choosing classes you might enjoyWhere you live, you mean.
[25-08-2014 00:42:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: You don't pick your classes here. You get designated specific classes and by all means take all the time you need.
[25-08-2014 00:43:44] Rezby: true, but there's also a trade off, if you take too many non-required classes, you will likely end up delaying the time it takes to get the degree and get out, since every year costs approx 30k. I've already taken too many non-required classes and I will not be graduating by the end of my 4th year.
[25-08-2014 00:44:27] Rezby: and yeah, thats basically the US system, some european nations do it differently, my parents had it the same way as you hiryu, when they were going to institutes in the soviet union
[25-08-2014 00:49:25] Rezby: hey hiryu, you play borderlands 1/2, right?
[25-08-2014 00:49:33] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: aye
[25-08-2014 00:49:43] Rezby: they're on sale rn, and I'm considering picking one up
[25-08-2014 00:49:47] Rezby: I've never played either
[25-08-2014 00:49:54] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: best start with the first one then
[25-08-2014 00:49:58] Rezby: borderlands 2 is 2 bucks cheaper
[25-08-2014 00:50:05] Rezby: but I was inclined towards the first one
[25-08-2014 00:50:06] Rezby: alright
[25-08-2014 00:50:11] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I bet the first one comes with all the dlcs
[25-08-2014 01:00:52] Rezby: yep, just got the game of the year edition for cheap on steam. I'll probably boot it up at some point tonight
[25-08-2014 02:02:40] Neko-chan~: i move into my dorms in about a week, then school starts on tuesday

[26-08-2014 04:13:57] Neko-chan~: dark humour does not equate jokes at someone's expense, dude
[26-08-2014 04:14:13] Neko-chan~: dark humour is like... george carlin or what not
[26-08-2014 04:17:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'm literally the only one here not seeing the problem with this whole mother/daughter issue, right?
[26-08-2014 04:17:21] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Guess so x:

[26-08-2014 04:17:37] Neko-chan~: my mother is actually a bad parent, i haven't really gone into detail about it here
[26-08-2014 04:17:45] Neko-chan~: it's a hassle, i don't like talking about it
[26-08-2014 04:17:57] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you have mentioned several times, actually
[26-08-2014 04:18:04] Artan: mmhm
[26-08-2014 04:18:06] Neko-chan~: not in great detail, please trust me
[26-08-2014 04:18:42] Artan: I think telling us about 6 cops coming into your house to stop a scuffle is pretty detailed
[26-08-2014 04:18:47] Neko-chan~: nope
[26-08-2014 04:18:50] Neko-chan~: that was tame shit
[26-08-2014 04:19:07] Neko-chan~: you don't know what i have gone through
[26-08-2014 04:19:19] Neko-chan~: i've gone through hell, just leave it alone
[26-08-2014 04:19:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: let me guess
[26-08-2014 04:19:37] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: bruised to the point of wanting to get a restraining order on her?
[26-08-2014 04:20:07] Neko-chan~: no but she has held my head down on my bed and put her full weight against my back with her knee as i screamed in pain
[26-08-2014 04:20:24] Neko-chan~: and she has bashed my head against a wondow sill
[26-08-2014 04:20:34] Neko-chan~: and has thrown an electric fan at me
[26-08-2014 04:20:40] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: that's... pretty tame
[26-08-2014 04:20:56] Neko-chan~: she has gotten into a fist fight with my sister which left her bruised on the street
[26-08-2014 04:21:03] Neko-chan~: my sister that is*
[26-08-2014 04:21:29] Neko-chan~: even if you think it's tame, it's still wrong
[26-08-2014 04:21:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: lady, bruises tend to have a dark colour
[26-08-2014 04:22:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: for a good while in my life, my arms resembled the arms that belong to a certain loved gamma-radiation bomb monster.

[26-08-2014 04:24:25] Neko-chan~: plus my mother is emotionally abusive and neglectful which can be just as bad, it just doesn't physically show... i give my sympathies to anyone else in here who has gone through it
[26-08-2014 04:40:06] Artan: My dad was/is pretty absusive

[26-08-2014 04:44:14] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: when his daughter was born

[06-09-2014 13:34:45] Vegedus-dono~: It's a classic example of american hypocrisy. The most free country in the world my ass.

[06-09-2014 13:38:20 | Edited 13:38:28] Vegedus-dono~: Prefer cookies or hookah form anyway.
[06-09-2014 13:38:35] Neko-chan~: cookies? lol and yea a lot of people like hookah
[06-09-2014 13:39:47] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah, tried hash cookies once and it was da bomb.
[06-09-2014 13:40:00] Neko-chan~: pfft wow nice
[06-09-2014 13:40:13] Vegedus-dono~: ... Mainly because I ate way too many because it had a very delayed effect.

[06-09-2014 13:41:59] Vegedus-dono~: Nah, the extra energy in alcohol really affects me. I often get very excited.
[06-09-2014 13:42:03] Vegedus-dono~: Like to dance and such.
[06-09-2014 13:42:24] Neko-chan~: ooh nice, a fun drunk
[06-09-2014 13:43:24 | Edited 13:43:28] Neko-chan~: i get really unbalanced so i can't really dance when i'm drunk
[06-09-2014 13:43:49] Neko-chan~: i just get affectionate and hungry
[06-09-2014 13:44:57] Vegedus-dono~: Hahh, those happen too.
[06-09-2014 13:45:49] Neko-chan~: i also get horny but duh
[06-09-2014 13:46:04] Neko-chan~: i rarely get to get drunk, though, because of my age boo
[06-09-2014 13:51:10] Neko-chan~: what drinks are your liking veggie?

[06-09-2014 15:06:10] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: no, I'd see you get drunk
[06-09-2014 15:06:26] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: cause if I don't need to get drunk to suffer a hangover, might as well not drink
[06-09-2014 15:10:11] Neko-chan~: what do you mean?
[06-09-2014 15:10:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Literally that I get hungover without getting drunk
[06-09-2014 15:11:42] Neko-chan~: that's uh...unfortunate
[06-09-2014 15:11:51 | Edited 15:14:08] Neko-chan~: i could help ya, i got hang over remedies
[06-09-2014 15:12:16] Neko-chan~: you'd probably just laugh at my drunkeness... call me adorable
[06-09-2014 15:13:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: or pass out
[06-09-2014 15:13:30] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: cause I get sleepy when I drink
[06-09-2014 15:14:02] Neko-chan~: aww
[06-09-2014 15:14:39] Neko-chan~: are you a light weight or a heavy weight?
[06-09-2014 15:14:54] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: well I never got drunk in my life so I dunno
[06-09-2014 15:17:23] Neko-chan~: hmm
[06-09-2014 15:17:55] Neko-chan~: i've only been drunk a few times and i still don't know but i use alcohol as an excuse to be more outgoing so no one else would know either haha
[06-09-2014 19:28:21] Rezby: I've only been drunk once, and I don't think I'll ever do that again. 10+ shots in a single night...
[06-09-2014 19:29:02] Rezby: I've got about 4 years and 25 more pounds to my name now, tho
[06-09-2014 19:30:31] Rezby: Also, I had jury duty yesterday. I was picked out of the grand jury to return on Monday and be a trial juror. So I get to email all my profs about how I'll be missing class until further notice.
[06-09-2014 19:32:00] Rezby: On the plus side, I got a check for 17.20.
[06-09-2014 20:05:16] Neko-chan~: Oooh jury duty, is it serious?
[06-09-2014 20:06:28] Rezby: I'm not legally allowed to disclose any details of the case until it concludes, but yes, I'd say it's a fairly serious offense the person's been charged with.
[06-09-2014 20:06:44] Rezby: Judge said case shouldn't take more than a week, but I'm skeptical.
[06-09-2014 20:07:10] Neko-chan~: Oh I know I know, I was being a sneak lol but oh rezby, got your hands fulk
[06-09-2014 22:00:42] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: [6. september 2014 20:06] Rezby: 

<<< I'm not legally allowed to disclose any details of the case until it concludesWhat if the person ain't even in the country?
[06-09-2014 22:01:43] Rezby: then you can wait until the case concludes just like everybody in country :P
[06-09-2014 22:02:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so no loophole, got it
[06-09-2014 22:02:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: in other news, I made chocolate mousse
[06-09-2014 22:02:32] Rezby: ooh

[06-09-2014 22:02:39] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: home mode, none of that pre-made mix from the package
[06-09-2014 22:02:50] Rezby: how many mice died in the making? :P
[06-09-2014 22:03:19] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I dunno, I'd have to ask the people that made the cooking chocolate I bought
[06-09-2014 22:04:08] Rezby: is it tasty?
[06-09-2014 22:04:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: should be
[06-09-2014 22:04:33] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: ain't the first time I've made it
[06-09-2014 22:04:51] Rezby: how do you feel about shipping some my way? :P
[06-09-2014 22:05:06] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it wouldn't survive the trip
[06-09-2014 22:05:07] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: :D

[00:56:29] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: how sad
[00:59:00] Spider  Tiki: Nudes are weird to talk about, at least when they werent sent to you or the other person doesnt want others to know
[00:59:36] Spider  Tiki: I mean I could say aww man but I'd be a creep
[00:59:54] Spider  Tiki: I could say good, but id sound like a douche
[01:00:16] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: 'aww man'? : |
[01:00:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I always told her "your boobs are amazing"
[01:00:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I'm like, "Oh hey, she's naked o3o welp, that was good".
[01:02:04] Neko-chan~: i would be pissed if my nudes were shown to anyone i didn't want seeing them
[01:02:12] Neko-chan~: only people i trust get to see me...
[01:04:32] Spider  Tiki: Rightly so
[01:05:13] Spider  Tiki: Anybody got a movie other people generally hated that you liked? Or vice versa
[01:09:54] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: No clue
[01:10:29] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I usually don't care for the popular ones cause they're overhyped and I'm proven right once they're seen off of the big screen
[01:15:26] rengishi: Liiiiike godzilla pacific rim , avatar and tmnt by chance?
[01:15:43] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Avatar is the oldest example I can remember
[01:15:51] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: but yes, like that
[01:16:15] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it all looks fucking awesome in the big screen but once you see it on a regular sized one you end up shrugging it off as an ok movie
[01:17:12] Neko-chan~: hmm sometimes yea
[01:17:20] Neko-chan~: the big screen makes things so glamorous sometimes
[01:34:03] Neko-chan~: everytime i remember something else i've lost forever, i inhale a great deal of air through my teeth and think "fuck"
[01:57:01] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I sensed a disturbance in the air while the house went silent
[01:57:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I knew it was something that would hurt me, something that would make curse my family to the high heavens
[01:57:26] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and dear baby Jesus was I right
[01:57:41] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: My mom did everything she could to stop me from knowing...
[01:57:51] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: SHE HID THE FACT THAT SHE MADE POPCORN
[01:57:56] Neko-chan~: pffft

[02:07:42] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: as to be expected
[02:07:44] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: now, another question
[02:07:54] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: your popcorn... microwave or stove?
[02:08:10] Neko-chan~: well considering we don't have stoves in the dorms

[02:23:50] live:mad-doctor_1: then again why would a popcorn stand not be in theaters
[02:24:49] Neko-chan~: do you guys have like... a projector and shiz?
[02:25:10] live:mad-doctor_1: yep, the screen is actually painted onto the wall
[02:25:18] live:mad-doctor_1: I feel so spoiled
[02:25:56] Neko-chan~: oh yea you said that to me, i'm so forgetful
[02:26:08] Neko-chan~: that's legit
[02:26:22] Neko-chan~: a movie theater right in your home
[02:26:34] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: oh man
[02:26:39] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: the size of monsters on Monster Hunter...

[02:27:02] Neko-chan~: oooh i didn't think of that
[02:27:10 | Edited 02:27:14] Neko-chan~: video games on the big screen *o*
[02:27:27] live:mad-doctor_1: All i have been playing is skyrim, so, dragons to kill
[02:27:39] live:mad-doctor_1: and sneaking and stabbing
[02:29:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Multiplayer games, man
[02:29:28] live:mad-doctor_1: I do play tf2 may i remind you
[02:29:39] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: no, no, no
[02:29:43] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: LOCAL multiplayer
[02:29:52] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: like fighting games
[02:30:23] live:mad-doctor_1: *does not compute*
[02:30:45] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it should, you sniviling cub
[02:31:23] Neko-chan~: i have to redownload all my steam games... *sits in corner*
[02:31:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: just redownload the ones you'll actually play
[02:31:44] live:mad-doctor_1: Why am i the only one that seems to enjoy being sucked into games like skyrim
[02:31:56] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I've played a lot of Skyrim myself, boy
[02:32:29] live:mad-doctor_1: I installed the frostfall mod.
[02:32:59] live:mad-doctor_1: great mod
[02:33:49] live:mad-doctor_1: I actually panicked when I got that vampiris disease because being out at night all the time is actually pretty difficult
[02:34:42] live:mad-doctor_1: dealling with cold
[02:34:45] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I plan on doing all the companions crap at some point and then will I turn into a vampire
[02:34:54 | Edited 02:35:27] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: cause it fits my spellthief lifestyle
[02:35:31] live:mad-doctor_1: This playthrough, i focus on being an assassin
[02:35:51] live:mad-doctor_1: not so much on the thief part but the plain sneaking and killing
[02:36:22] live:mad-doctor_1: became a werewolf on the other hand
[02:37:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I downloaded a mod to allow me to use destruction spells while sneaking
[02:37:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it was exactly what I wanted
[02:37:56] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: my mods are mostly game improving ones
[02:38:12] live:mad-doctor_1: i also have this kickass predator mod
[02:38:34] live:mad-doctor_1: That adds predators throuought skyrim and also xenomorphs
[02:39:03] live:mad-doctor_1: I encountered quite a few predators early in the game
[02:39:28] live:mad-doctor_1: attempting to attack them at the time was futile
[02:39:34] live:mad-doctor_1: but man i want their stuff
[02:40:48] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: bah
[02:40:52] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: not the kind of thing I want
[02:41:08] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: what I want is to gain more perk points instead of just one per level!
[02:41:34] live:mad-doctor_1: That is something useful
[02:42:00] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: exactly
[02:42:10] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and I do have 'em, but I just haven't used 'em yet
[02:42:18] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: have to spend 1 dragon soul per point
[02:43:59] live:mad-doctor_1: But there are mods like that that break game balance
[02:44:29] live:mad-doctor_1: For example, I once played a bit with a mod that let's you craft lightsabers
[02:44:39] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: really depends on how they work, I still have to level the skills if I wanna learn the perks
