[10-08-2014 02:09:32] Vegedus-dono~: I... Have trouble still caring about DBZ.
[10-08-2014 02:09:46] Vegedus-dono~: Despite being half-named after one of the characters.
[10-08-2014 02:09:57] Tuor-onii-sama!~: hahaha
[10-08-2014 02:10:19] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Gonna go watch Guardians of the Galaxy now (happy)

[10-08-2014 02:32:22] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: to be fair
[10-08-2014 02:32:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: all Disney made Marvel movies get hyped to Kingdom Come
[10-08-2014 02:32:51] Vegedus-dono~: At this rate, I can only be dissapointed when I watch it and it doesn't cure cancer.
[10-08-2014 02:32:58] Vegedus-dono~: Not entirely true.
[10-08-2014 02:33:02] Tuor-onii-sama!~: :P
[10-08-2014 02:33:15] Vegedus-dono~: More controversy than hype for the first captain america.
[10-08-2014 02:33:39] Vegedus-dono~: Same with most of the non-avenger, non-iron man movie. More a pensive, 'well it could be good?'
[10-08-2014 02:35:06] Vegedus-dono~: Now they've established themselves though, so it's gonna be every movie from now on
[10-08-2014 02:35:58] Warby-kun~: first Captain America movie wasn't Disney.
[10-08-2014 02:36:19] Warby-kun~: they didn't have Marvel until...I wanna say partway through Avengers
[10-08-2014 02:36:40] Vegedus-dono~: Oh. Huh.
[10-08-2014 02:36:54] Vegedus-dono~: I didn't realize that, thought it was them that practically bank-rolled the venture.
[10-08-2014 02:38:14] Warby-kun~: nah
[10-08-2014 02:38:33] Warby-kun~: the first movie they were with all the way through was...Iron Man 3?
[10-08-2014 02:38:44] Vegedus-dono~: Welp, nope, according to wikipedia, marvel was bought in 2009. Which was after Iron Man, but before Captain America
[10-08-2014 02:38:53] Warby-kun~: oh
[10-08-2014 02:38:56] Warby-kun~: huh
[10-08-2014 02:39:04] Vegedus-dono~: But yeah, the other movies had been in production elsewhere before that.
[10-08-2014 02:39:10] Warby-kun~: yeah
[10-08-2014 02:39:19] Vegedus-dono~: So Iron Man 3 may be right in "start to finish"
[10-08-2014 02:40:05] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Avengers
[10-08-2014 02:40:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: very first one by Disney apparently

[10-08-2014 03:30:11] Vegedus-dono~: Yes! Mixed signals!

[11-08-2014 08:54:21] Riz-chaaan~: Incidentally, I spent much of tonight cuddled with a guy

[11-08-2014 08:58:30] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I've walked arm to arm with my friend

Hehe, I like doing that
[11-08-2014 09:04:22] Karuama-oneechan~: So just don't worry about such things, because everybody's different and everything takes time.
[11-08-2014 09:05:10] Karuama-oneechan~: Also, from my limited experience I think big girls have nicer hands
[11-08-2014 09:05:22] Riz-chaaan~: For me being single isn't much different from being in a relationship because I've only had LDR's, I don't even know if I'm enjoying the single life since its not really that different
[11-08-2014 09:05:56] Calek Albion: my only relationship was kinda long distance, she was in another city but I saw her at least once a week

[11-08-2014 09:08:05] Karuama-oneechan~: Softer is generally better when it comes to hands I think.

[11-08-2014 09:08:43] Karuama-oneechan~: And my experience with LDR is fairly different from being single just due to the quantity of communication with one person.

[11-08-2014 21:55:45] Calek Albion: who cares, it shouldn't affect you in anyway, just don't see it, other people will enjoy it just let them

[11-08-2014 22:03:00] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'd say Agent X but that's just DP with less humour and more amnesia.
[11-08-2014 22:03:19] Calek Albion: put him in a Deadpool movie and it'd work
[11-08-2014 22:04:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Taskmaster will probably show up in the DP movies

[14-08-2014 21:20:48] Fummo-chan~: I'm talking like if they ever do another avatar
[14-08-2014 21:21:10] calek01: they should go into the far future
[14-08-2014 21:21:26] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Like, in a more distant future than where Korra is now?
[14-08-2014 21:21:35] calek01: indeed
[14-08-2014 21:21:54] calek01: unrelated to any of the current characters, brand new story
[14-08-2014 21:22:03] Fummo-chan~: MECH
[14-08-2014 21:22:05] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Avatar was during around 1800s, Korra seems to be during the 1900s, and the "next one" can be during the 2000s and beyond.
[14-08-2014 21:22:11] Artan: But if we keep going into the future there are less and less benders
[14-08-2014 21:22:26] Fummo-chan~: thats a good concept
[14-08-2014 21:22:35] Fummo-chan~: actually with the portals open
[14-08-2014 21:22:41] Fummo-chan~: there would be an increase
[14-08-2014 21:22:51] Artan: After Korra I don't think they'll continue the series tho x:
[14-08-2014 21:23:04] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: KICKSTARTER, GOGOGOG
[14-08-2014 21:23:25] Stuff-chan~: I don't think it was planned to do another
[14-08-2014 21:23:39] Stuff-chan~: Just 4 seasons of Korra
[14-08-2014 21:23:48] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I doubt it with what happened to the series now, heading online
[14-08-2014 21:23:51] Stuff-chan~: ...which originally was gonna be 1
[14-08-2014 21:23:56] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Doubt a new series will fruition
[14-08-2014 21:25:00] calek01: I wish they changed the ending to series 1 when they heard the news they got to make more
[14-08-2014 21:25:33] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Has anyone read the comics of Avatar?
[14-08-2014 21:25:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: "The Promise" and "The Search"?

[15-08-2014 22:20:31] Vegedus-dono~: Morrowind only had proper expansions, far as I know.
[15-08-2014 22:21:37] Artan: tbh I don't really count the horse armor as true dlc.more of some cosmetic thing they added for god knows what reason

<<< my buddy started the main questline in Skyrim at level 23 and got completely wrecked.Skyrim has level scaling too, but it's so subtle I've never figured out how it works or find any good sources of it on the intervebs.
[15-08-2014 23:56:09] Warby-kun~: I don't think I've ever broken a pick.
[15-08-2014 23:56:19] Calek Albion: that seems unlikely
[15-08-2014 23:56:22] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: there's a mod to "fix" the level scaling
[15-08-2014 23:56:30] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: apparently mobs stop leveling past 30
[15-08-2014 23:56:30] Warby-kun~: maybe on master locks.
[15-08-2014 23:56:33] Warby-kun~: that's about it.
[15-08-2014 23:56:34] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: with the mod, they continue to level
[15-08-2014 23:56:45] Calek Albion: oh right you probably upgraded your lockpicking skills
[15-08-2014 23:56:47] Calek Albion: I never did
[15-08-2014 23:56:51] Warby-kun~: I did!
[15-08-2014 23:56:56] Warby-kun~: sneaky rogue.
[15-08-2014 23:57:01] Warby-kun~: all the way.
[15-08-2014 23:57:14] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: spellthief!
[15-08-2014 23:57:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: bless that mod
[15-08-2014 23:58:35] Tuor-onii-sama!~: sneaky rogue is a must do playthrough in elder scrolls games
[15-08-2014 23:58:59] Calek Albion: I heard bow and arrow and stealth is overpowerd
[15-08-2014 23:58:59] Warby-kun~: I love the custom signs from Oblivion tho.
[15-08-2014 23:59:06] Warby-kun~: IT IS
[15-08-2014 23:59:15] Warby-kun~: crossbows make it so worse
[15-08-2014 23:59:23] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: ranged attacks and sneak is broken, really
[15-08-2014 23:59:31] Warby-kun~: always has been
[15-08-2014 23:59:35] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: yup
[15-08-2014 23:59:53] Vegedus-dono~: But whatever, combat in TES games isn't that interesting
[16-08-2014 00:00:18] Vegedus-dono~: I didn't install the level scaling 'fix' because I really didn't care to make every combat encounter longer
[16-08-2014 00:00:42] Artan: Combat really was the only thing that was unfixable, and I've tried a dozen or so mods :/
[16-08-2014 00:00:46] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I installed mods to improve gameplay and fps
[16-08-2014 00:01:41] Calek Albion: there's a game coming out or recently came out that focuses a lot on first person combat, it's a fantasy game and wish I could remember it
[16-08-2014 00:03:32] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Gearbox is working on a FPS Moba
[16-08-2014 00:04:19] Vegedus-dono~: Welp, there's already Super Monday Night Combat.
[16-08-2014 00:05:00] Vegedus-dono~: Which I only played for a short time because it felt weird that players could survive something like 50 bullets.
[16-08-2014 00:07:55] Calek Albion: that's the good kind of FPS
[16-08-2014 00:08:06] Artan: Kingdom of Deverance
[16-08-2014 00:08:14] Artan: is the game I think youre thinking
[16-08-2014 00:08:24] Artan: I may have spelt it wrong though
[16-08-2014 00:08:36] Calek Albion: Deliverance
[16-08-2014 00:08:41] Artan: Thank you
[16-08-2014 00:08:54] Calek Albion: nah it's not that, the one I'm thinking of is a fantasy game
[16-08-2014 00:12:01] Artan: So it's not Kingdom Come: Deliverance? The one thats set in medieval times and focusing on hand to hand FPS combat
[16-08-2014 00:12:21] Calek Albion: that's what I said
[16-08-2014 00:12:34] Artan: Damn then I don't know which game it is
[16-08-2014 00:23:33] Riz-chaaan~: What a bunch of nerds

[16-08-2014 00:38:31] Tuor-onii-sama!~: by being an arts major =D
[16-08-2014 00:39:06] Artan: Oh thats good for us Art Majors, cause I can't read
[16-08-2014 00:39:28] Tuor-onii-sama!~: B-but you DO need that as an arts major

[16-08-2014 00:39:38] Tuor-onii-sama!~: then ya, you're fine
[16-08-2014 00:40:47] Calek Albion: not an art major but an art major
[16-08-2014 00:42:45] Riz-chaaan~: There's a difference
[16-08-2014 00:43:14] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I said I was an ARTS major, not an ART major, and ya, there's a difference

[17-08-2014 09:58:38] Hiroko-imouto~: Because you are a weenie, Exodis.
[17-08-2014 09:58:54] calek01: almost thought you called me a weenie looooool
[17-08-2014 09:59:06] Hiroko-imouto~: THAT'S WHY I CLARIFIED IMMEDIATELY
[17-08-2014 09:59:18] Hiroko-imouto~: YOU ARE NOT A WEENIE, CALEK--I don't think, anyway.
[17-08-2014 09:59:27] Hiroko-imouto~: Might need further analysis, tho
[17-08-2014 09:59:34] Hiroko-imouto~: Just to be sure.
[17-08-2014 09:59:46] Hiroko-imouto~: But I am 75% positive you are not a weenie.
[17-08-2014 10:00:00] calek01: I only looked away for one scene in Evil Dead reboot
[17-08-2014 10:00:03] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: [17. august 2014 09:58] Hiroko-imouto~:

[17-08-2014 10:07:12] Calek Albion: start with the 2005 series and work your way up
[17-08-2014 10:07:27] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: What about before? Not important?
[17-08-2014 10:07:58] Calek Albion: the 2005 series was designed for new comers and sprinkled in enough stuff for old fans for them to go "ah ha I know that"
[17-08-2014 10:08:09] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Ohhh okay
[17-08-2014 10:08:11] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Sounds good!
[17-08-2014 10:08:16] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I'll start to watch it.

<<< wait are you calling me a weenie?
Yes
[17-08-2014 10:08:40] Calek Albion: understandable, takes me like 15 minutes to get rid of a spider
[17-08-2014 10:09:22] Calek Albion: what am I even watching right now
[17-08-2014 10:09:38] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: What are you even watching
[17-08-2014 10:09:43] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Also, 15 minutes? Jaysus
[17-08-2014 10:09:49] Calek Albion: spiders are scary
[17-08-2014 10:09:57] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Well, some
[17-08-2014 10:10:07] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: The small ones I just let 'em free
[17-08-2014 10:10:20] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: The big ones? Where's mah boot... and armor
[17-08-2014 10:11:09] Hiroko-imouto~: I think Minecraft just made it worse with the spiders thing for me, pfft.
[17-08-2014 10:11:30] Calek Albion: I had to mod Legend of Grimrock to get rid of all the spider enemies
[17-08-2014 10:11:37] Hiroko-imouto~: what with them being huge and "skreeee"ing and jumping out of nowhere and *shudders*
[17-08-2014 10:11:50] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yeah, they're bad news those spiders>.>'
[17-08-2014 10:12:06] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Also, feels weird playing MC again after months/weeks not playing it
[17-08-2014 10:13:24] Warby-kun~: so if anyone here has played the Dawnguard DLC for Skyrim, I parted ways with Serana for a second and she said she would meet me at Darkfall Cave but I can't find her? D:
[17-08-2014 10:13:29 | Edited 10:13:40] Hiroko-imouto~: @Exodis: Didn't like playing it by yourself, I guess?
[17-08-2014 10:14:01] Calek Albion: every time I travel and I can't find my companion I freak out, because I think they died
[17-08-2014 10:15:00 | Edited 10:15:07] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: [17. august 2014 10:13] Hiroko-imouto~: 

<<< @Exodis: Didn't like playing it by yourself, I guess?That too. But, with finding a new server to play on, feels weird playing MC again. Playing alone  is no fun without others.
[17-08-2014 10:15:18] Warby-kun~: I once had Serana bug out in a cave and she wouldn't leave until a few teleports and "cutscenes" later. :B
[17-08-2014 10:15:59] Karuama-oneechan~: All y'all are a bunch o' weenies.
[17-08-2014 10:16:09] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: AT LEAST WE GET MILKSHAKES
[17-08-2014 10:16:22] Karuama-oneechan~: YOU GET NOTHING
[17-08-2014 10:16:24] Warby-kun~: well fuck. where the hell did she go...
[17-08-2014 10:16:25] Hiroko-imouto~: [17. august 2014 10:14] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: 

<<< That too. But, with finding a new server to play on, feels weird playing MC again. Playing alone  is no fun without others.I'm not super fond of playing by myself, either. Which is awkward when you're in a server with a few others, and you still end up mostly being by yourself.
[17-08-2014 10:16:31] Warby-kun~: I wonder if she went to the fort...
[17-08-2014 10:18:45] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: That's actually true. But, it feels good when there is someone around when you are playing in a server than just alone. Idk, it depends.
Single player and always alone? Nope.
In a server where you will sometimes be alone? Well, the times you aren't alone is nice.
[17-08-2014 10:18:52] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Idk, iz weird and all.
[17-08-2014 10:20:00] Warby-kun~: Minecraft is a really isolated game and it's really easy to feel alone while playing it.
[17-08-2014 10:20:27] Warby-kun~: you're in a big world all on your own. it's nice to have a few friends around, even if they don't talk much. it's comforting.
[17-08-2014 10:21:07] Hiroko-imouto~: It hasn't really been that way for me for the past couple of days, so... >x>;
[17-08-2014 10:21:26] Warby-kun~: yeah well, you haven't been in a great mood either. :P
[17-08-2014 10:21:39] Hiroko-imouto~: Exactly.
[17-08-2014 10:21:56] Hiroko-imouto~: So Minecraft hasn't been helping much, in that respect.;;;;
[17-08-2014 10:22:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (hug)
[17-08-2014 10:22:19] Hiroko-imouto~: (hug)
[17-08-2014 10:22:33] Warby-kun~: god fucking dammit Serana where are you
[17-08-2014 10:22:54] Hiroko-imouto~: Maybe she ran away and joined a circus?
[17-08-2014 10:23:18] Warby-kun~: the only clown I know of in Skyrim is an assassin, so that wouldn't be unlikely.
[17-08-2014 10:24:17] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: [17. august 2014 10:22] Hiroko-imouto~: 

<<< Maybe she ran away and joined a circus?Yes, because that's the only option she has. |-(
[17-08-2014 10:24:24] Warby-kun~: WHAT THE FUCK
[17-08-2014 10:24:27] Warby-kun~: SHE LIED TO ME
[17-08-2014 10:24:39] Warby-kun~: SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO A CAVE AND SHE WAS AT THE FORT
[17-08-2014 10:24:46] Hiroko-imouto~: pfffffffft
[17-08-2014 10:25:10] Warby-kun~: I don't even know if I want her with me anymore :c
[17-08-2014 10:25:44] Hiroko-imouto~: Well if she lied about this, what else could she be lying about?
[17-08-2014 10:25:53] Calek Albion: I bet she sold all your stuff
[17-08-2014 10:26:48] Warby-kun~: all she had on her was an elven dagger, so...
[17-08-2014 10:27:16] Warby-kun~: I have all the good stuff under lock and key in Lakeview Manor. ;)
[17-08-2014 10:28:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: LIES AND SLANDER
[17-08-2014 10:28:39] Warby-kun~: literally all of my gems and expensive shit are in lock boxes.
[17-08-2014 10:28:52] Warby-kun~: strong boxes? whatever they're called.
[17-08-2014 10:29:01] Calek Albion: chests
[17-08-2014 10:29:09] Calek Albion: you're in a fantasy world man use the lingo!
[17-08-2014 10:29:15] Warby-kun~: no they're smaller and made of metal.
[17-08-2014 10:29:25] Calek Albion: teeny tiny chest
[17-08-2014 10:30:04] Warby-kun~: I'm presently staring at one and it says it's a strong box. frick you.
[17-08-2014 10:30:52] Calek Albion: whatever the game's wrong
[17-08-2014 10:31:32] Riz-chaaan~: Obviously
[17-08-2014 10:31:38] Warby-kun~: you're wrong. >:T
[17-08-2014 10:31:52] Riz-chaaan~: Rood
[17-08-2014 10:33:24] Hiroko-imouto~: Clearly it's a chibi chest.
[17-08-2014 10:33:48] Warby-kun~: oh don't even start
[17-08-2014 10:34:33] Hiroko-imouto~: chiiiiiiiiiisaiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[17-08-2014 19:08:14] Stuff-chan~: Basically, a dollar store or something similar to it, mispelled spooky.
[17-08-2014 19:08:28] Stuff-chan~: Come October I'm releasing it everywhere. Along with creppy.

[17-08-2014 19:31:36] Stuff-chan~: I just pwned some noobs on fb
[17-08-2014 19:32:41] Stuff-chan~: People are basically shitting on the ice bucket challenge, with this image of a African child that says "you waste clean water to avoid giving money to a charity?"
[17-08-2014 19:33:22] Stuff-chan~: So I wrote a nice thing and called them out and left them a nice website to donate to, for clean water, since they're jackasses. : 3

[18-08-2014 09:26:50] Hiroko-imouto~: Right now I'm just crossing my fingers that it actually happens, though.
[18-08-2014 09:27:09] Hiroko-imouto~: Since...it's been kinda difficult to plan things or even just talk to this friend of mine.

[18-08-2014 10:01:57] Tuor-onii-sama!~: or refusing journalists entry to the area
[18-08-2014 10:02:31] calek01: they're just a tad over equipped
[18-08-2014 10:02:52] Tuor-onii-sama!~: just a tad
[18-08-2014 10:03:20] Tuor-onii-sama!~: if I'd given no context to the second gif, would you have even though he was a) a police officer or b) in america?
[18-08-2014 10:03:53] calek01: nah he looks like a proper military soldier

[18-08-2014 10:05:08] calek01: I have a feeling none of this is going to end well
[18-08-2014 10:16:29] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: My god... this is horrible
[18-08-2014 11:23:00] Warby-kun~: "just a tad over-equipped" what makes you think that? the tanks?

[18-08-2014 12:55:19] Tuor-onii-sama!~: haha
[18-08-2014 12:55:40] Warby-kun~: I don't even know what I've accomplished
[18-08-2014 12:55:56] Warby-kun~: besides the inevitability of being exhausted at work because I need to be there in an hour
[18-08-2014 12:56:13] Tuor-onii-sama!~: :(
[18-08-2014 12:56:41] Warby-kun~: oh I became the thane of Solitude tho

[18-08-2014 12:58:20] Warby-kun~: I like doing these quests because I constantly see the books relating to them all over. it's neat.
[18-08-2014 12:58:30] Warby-kun~: elder scrolls has such interesting lore.
[18-08-2014 12:59:03] Warby-kun~: and all of the books have like
[18-08-2014 12:59:16] Warby-kun~: actually decent amounts of content
[18-08-2014 12:59:42] Warby-kun~: I can't even imagine having to write all that let alone do bug testing for it
[18-08-2014 13:00:45] Tuor-onii-sama!~: RIGHT?
[18-08-2014 13:01:06] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I love that the books have content
[18-08-2014 13:01:10] Warby-kun~: this is why I want to get into design rather than QA
[18-08-2014 13:01:12] Warby-kun~: jesus christ
[18-08-2014 13:02:59] Tuor-onii-sama!~: QA?
[18-08-2014 13:03:04] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Q & A?
[18-08-2014 13:06:47] Warby-kun~: no no.
[18-08-2014 13:06:47] Warby-kun~: QA.
[18-08-2014 13:06:51] Warby-kun~: quality assurance.
[18-08-2014 13:07:51] Warby-kun~: the accumulated time ensuring that everything in a game like Skyrim works as intended has to be at least ten times the total playtime of a file where you do literally everything you possibly can. l
[18-08-2014 13:08:01] Warby-kun~: it's obscene.
[18-08-2014 13:08:43] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Ah
[18-08-2014 13:08:45] Tuor-onii-sama!~: playtesting
[18-08-2014 13:08:46] Tuor-onii-sama!~: ?
[18-08-2014 13:09:06] Warby-kun~: to put it into a simple term...yeah? I suppose.
[18-08-2014 13:09:11] Tuor-onii-sama!~: aight
[18-08-2014 13:09:18] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I kinda would want that as a job
[18-08-2014 13:09:29] Tuor-onii-sama!~: but I'm sure that your reasons are more multifaceted than mine
[18-08-2014 13:09:40] Warby-kun~: it's not really as simple as playing the game
[18-08-2014 13:09:43] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I just think it'd be rad to be paid to play videoa games
[18-08-2014 13:09:46] Tuor-onii-sama!~: right
[18-08-2014 13:09:51] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I figured haha
[18-08-2014 13:11:43] Warby-kun~: you need to ensure that every item works in every scenario that they could be used in. all of the things you interact with EVER need to work as they should. ground and walls everywhere need to be completely solid and impossible to phase through (unless it's a specific ability that makes you able to do so...there's double the work right there)
[18-08-2014 13:11:48] Warby-kun~: it sounds awful.
[18-08-2014 13:12:01] Warby-kun~: and QA is blamed for literally everything wrong with a game.
[18-08-2014 13:12:16] Warby-kun~: unless it's plot or writing.
[18-08-2014 13:12:35] Tuor-onii-sama!~: true
[18-08-2014 13:13:16] Warby-kun~: sorry if I crushed your dreams. :P
[18-08-2014 13:15:25] Tuor-onii-sama!~: m=nah
[18-08-2014 13:15:26] Tuor-onii-sama!~: s'ok
[18-08-2014 13:15:30] Tuor-onii-sama!~: it wasn't really serious
[18-08-2014 13:15:45] Tuor-onii-sama!~: (flex)(cool)(beer)

[18-08-2014 15:30:13 | Edited 15:30:23] Vegedus-dono~: Tales from the trenches is basically a comic about how playtesting video games is a terrible gig http://trenchescomic.com/

[19-08-2014 20:21:45] Warby-kun~: it's important that they explicitly say it tho
[19-08-2014 20:24:55] Sefrol-kuuun~: Sucks that it's held back by possible backlash.
[19-08-2014 20:27:34] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: What you mean "possible"?

[19-08-2014 21:42:43] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Hey Calek, what'd you think of the DBZ movie anyway?
[19-08-2014 21:42:52] Calek Albion: I thought it was good
[19-08-2014 21:42:58] Calek Albion: more so for the comedy than the action
[19-08-2014 21:44:07] Calek Albion: the action was anticlimactic because it was a huge set up for something much better, but the comedy was pretty funny
[19-08-2014 21:45:23] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: The comedy was great
[19-08-2014 21:46:00] Calek Albion: the sequel is coming out next year apparently, Toriyama is doing a lot of the designs
[19-08-2014 21:46:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: What I liked most about the movie is Berus won, how it went different from the DBZ show/cartoon and had the other person win than Goku
[19-08-2014 21:47:12] Calek Albion: it's definitely setting up for Vegeta to get god powers too
[19-08-2014 21:50:10] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yet he still hasn't surpassed SSJ3...
[19-08-2014 21:50:23] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: And he never did, even in the GT series
[19-08-2014 21:50:30] Calek Albion: he will in the next movie I'm sure

[19-08-2014 21:51:16] Calek Albion: That'd be intense
[19-08-2014 21:52:10] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: In the next one, they might battle beings from other universes (as stated by Berus that there are beings in other universes stronger than him).
[19-08-2014 21:52:33] Calek Albion: I think Goku can now go Super Sayjin God whenever he wants now that he's done it once
[19-08-2014 21:53:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: -anticipation intensifies-
[19-08-2014 21:53:49] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Didn't Toriyama say he was thinking/starting up a new series for DBZ?
[19-08-2014 21:54:05] Calek Albion: that's the rumour
[19-08-2014 21:54:15] Calek Albion: I know he's done some more manga stuff involving Goku's mother
[19-08-2014 21:54:43] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Really? I thought he just confirmed who she was.
[19-08-2014 21:55:09] Calek Albion: he even gave Android 17 and 18 real names
[19-08-2014 21:55:19] Calek Albion: Lazuli for 18 and I dont' remember 17's
[19-08-2014 21:55:28] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I was just gonna say that, hahaha
[19-08-2014 21:55:56] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: It would be cool to see another DBZ series.
[19-08-2014 21:56:01] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Have you seen GT?
[19-08-2014 21:56:05] Calek Albion: I have not

[19-08-2014 21:57:01] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: People say GT was bad and how it took the elements from the DB/DBZ series.. idk, I wanna see it to believe.
Though, I need to watch DB first >.>'

[20-08-2014 00:52:40] Calek Albion: like there's being bad a game because you don't know anything, and then there's being bad at a game because you refuse to learn, this streamer is most certainly the latter

[20-08-2014 03:37:04] Warby-kun~: after having nightmares of being attacked by men for who knows how long.
[20-08-2014 03:37:18] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (sun)
[20-08-2014 03:37:23] Warby-kun~: she sleeps with this incredibly beat-up dude who could be a serial killer
[20-08-2014 03:37:27] Warby-kun~: SMART WRITING
[20-08-2014 03:37:34] calek01: that is pretty bad
[20-08-2014 03:37:37] Warby-kun~: THATS THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD WANT TO DO
[20-08-2014 03:37:51] Warby-kun~: BONE SOMEONE SUSPECTED OF KILLING PEOPLE
[20-08-2014 03:37:57] thefighterofthenightman: I like when you develop this one character, and then something happens and everything you've done for him became irrelevant because bad guy
[20-08-2014 03:37:58] calek01: the identity of the killer makes no sense
[20-08-2014 03:38:18] Warby-kun~: ugh yeah
[20-08-2014 03:38:26] Warby-kun~: you know what would have been cool?
[20-08-2014 03:38:46] Warby-kun~: Norman being the killer because he was super drugged out oh that VR shit.
[20-08-2014 03:39:00] Warby-kun~: THAT would be interesting and compelling.
[20-08-2014 03:39:01] Stuff-chan~: Norman Reedus is hawt
[20-08-2014 03:39:25] Warby-kun~: :B
[20-08-2014 03:39:35] Warby-kun~: play the new Silent Hill
[20-08-2014 03:39:37] Warby-kun~: he's in it
[20-08-2014 03:39:39] Warby-kun~: as himself
[20-08-2014 03:39:46] Stuff-chan~: I know 8D
[20-08-2014 03:39:48] Stuff-chan~: I need
[20-08-2014 03:39:50] Stuff-chan~: NEED
[20-08-2014 03:39:54] thefighterofthenightman: You know what would have been cool, not having Madison and instead have the wife
[20-08-2014 03:40:03] Warby-kun~: YUP
[20-08-2014 03:40:10] Stuff-chan~: I'll never get over him calling me a cutie
[20-08-2014 03:40:19] Warby-kun~: Madison is such a throwaway character
[20-08-2014 03:40:26] calek01: David Cage is absolutely one of those writers who thinks people like his stories because they don't get it
[20-08-2014 03:40:26] Warby-kun~: does she even DO anything?
[20-08-2014 03:40:32] Stuff-chan~: And being all hipster and knowing, and meeting him before he got super famous

She stripped
[20-08-2014 03:40:43] Warby-kun~: oooooooh
[20-08-2014 03:40:45] calek01: twice
[20-08-2014 03:40:52] Warby-kun~: and she slept with and took care of Ethan
[20-08-2014 03:40:57] Warby-kun~: what an important character
[20-08-2014 03:41:04] thefighterofthenightman: Totally cool with that
[20-08-2014 03:41:09] Warby-kun~: ugh
[20-08-2014 03:41:13] Stuff-chan~: Bethyl forever
[20-08-2014 03:41:29] Warby-kun~: you know what?
[20-08-2014 03:41:36] Warby-kun~: fuck Ethan. play as the wife.
[20-08-2014 03:41:42] Warby-kun~: that'd be kickass.
[20-08-2014 03:41:57] thefighterofthenightman: "You made me into a compelling character, fuck you I'm the bad guy watch me do bad guy things"
[20-08-2014 03:42:13] Warby-kun~: but have Madison be the exact same character in the same context.
[20-08-2014 03:42:37] calek01: have her sleep with Ethan's wife?
[20-08-2014 03:42:44] Warby-kun~: yes.
[20-08-2014 03:42:56] Warby-kun~: that's a more compelling narrative.
[20-08-2014 03:43:18] thefighterofthenightman: Maybe his wife would have gone to the police
[20-08-2014 03:43:29] calek01: having Ellen Page's story be all out of order like that was stupid
[20-08-2014 03:43:30] thefighterofthenightman: Like ethan should have done
[20-08-2014 03:43:39] Warby-kun~: he did tho
[20-08-2014 03:43:43] Warby-kun~: at first
[20-08-2014 03:44:03] Warby-kun~: BTS feels so shitty and disjointed because of that
[20-08-2014 03:44:17] thefighterofthenightman: Oh wait that's right, he had origami in his hand that's never explained how it got there
[20-08-2014 03:44:25] Warby-kun~: ...
[20-08-2014 03:44:29] Warby-kun~: wait you're right
[20-08-2014 03:44:46] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Silent Hills looks disturbingly pretty o3o
[20-08-2014 03:44:48] calek01: that's left over plot devices from a scrapped story line
[20-08-2014 03:44:48] Warby-kun~: why was he even blacking out?
[20-08-2014 03:45:01] Warby-kun~: THEN GET RID OF IT
[20-08-2014 03:45:14] calek01: and then they left that stuff in because "oh man is he the killer?!?"
[20-08-2014 03:45:15] Stuff-chan~: Spoilers lolol
[20-08-2014 03:45:24] Warby-kun~: jesus christ
[20-08-2014 03:45:47] Warby-kun~: yes, you're going to make your story more compelling by giving it MASSIVE PLOTHOLES
[20-08-2014 03:45:52] Warby-kun~: AND INCONSISTENCIES
[20-08-2014 03:45:54] Warby-kun~: GENIUS
[20-08-2014 03:46:02] calek01: ~* So Deep *~
[20-08-2014 03:46:03] *** Stuff-chan~ has changed the conversation topic to "Rapscallions: Some Canadians and videogames." ***

All to make you think it's him, never mind the how and why
[20-08-2014 03:46:34] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Mojang forbids capes on minecraft now...
[20-08-2014 03:46:44] calek01: what why
[20-08-2014 03:47:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: they want it to be mojang ONLY
[20-08-2014 03:47:06] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: as in
[20-08-2014 03:47:10] Warby-kun~: ...
[20-08-2014 03:47:10] Warby-kun~: but
[20-08-2014 03:47:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you can only get what they give you
[20-08-2014 03:47:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: no custom mods to show 'em
[20-08-2014 03:47:18] Warby-kun~: ...
[20-08-2014 03:47:24] Warby-kun~: okay so
[20-08-2014 03:47:27] Stuff-chan~: Welp
[20-08-2014 03:47:34] Warby-kun~: good luck getting to Gamescom, everyone
[20-08-2014 03:47:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so only the special snowflakes get capes
[20-08-2014 03:48:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Snowflakes o3o
[20-08-2014 03:48:22] calek01: http://i.imgur.com/DnLqugG.png ugh didn't even notice that the first time seeing it
[20-08-2014 03:48:47] Warby-kun~: you mean the giant creature?
[20-08-2014 03:48:59] calek01: yah
[20-08-2014 03:49:12] calek01: really hope we get to actually fight it instead of it being a Dragon God/Bed of Chaos fight
[20-08-2014 03:49:16] Warby-kun~: is that coming out for PS3 AND PS4?
[20-08-2014 03:49:37] calek01: no just PS4
[20-08-2014 03:49:42] calek01: purely current gen thank goodness
[20-08-2014 03:49:44] thefighterofthenightman: Also
[20-08-2014 03:49:55] Warby-kun~: FUCK
[20-08-2014 03:50:00] Warby-kun~: guess I'm not playing it
[20-08-2014 03:50:19] Warby-kun~: Bed of Chaos is only cool because it comes back in DS2.
[20-08-2014 03:50:42] calek01: where was it in DS2
[20-08-2014 03:50:54] Warby-kun~: fun-fact corner with Warbear!
[20-08-2014 03:51:25] Warby-kun~: the Bed of Chaos originates from a Firekeeper that twisted their soul to become a bonfire.
[20-08-2014 03:51:44] Warby-kun~: inevitably creating the Chaos Flame and all the evil in the world.
[20-08-2014 03:51:46] calek01: oh right it's related to The Lost Sinner aint it
[20-08-2014 03:51:52] Warby-kun~: yeah.
[20-08-2014 03:51:56] Warby-kun~: I'm getting to it.
[20-08-2014 03:51:59] Stuff-chan~: Just hissed at my sister's cat
[20-08-2014 03:52:00] Stuff-chan~: It ran
[20-08-2014 03:52:07] Stuff-chan~: 8D

[20-08-2014 03:52:25] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Poor Cat :c
[20-08-2014 03:52:30] Stuff-chan~: This cat sucks
[20-08-2014 03:52:37] Stuff-chan~: The worst
[20-08-2014 03:52:38] Warby-kun~: she was cursed by this and became a bug. the one in the middle of the Bed of Chaos and the one that slithers into the Lost Sinner.
[20-08-2014 03:52:48] Tuor-onii-sama!~: was it whatsitsface, niko?
[20-08-2014 03:52:54] Stuff-chan~: Mhmmm
[20-08-2014 03:53:03] Warby-kun~: the Lost Sinner IS the Bed of Chaos.
[20-08-2014 03:53:06] Warby-kun~: technically.
[20-08-2014 03:53:27] Warby-kun~: hence the name.
[20-08-2014 03:53:32] calek01: I wish the Souls games would adopt a competent narritive
[20-08-2014 03:53:37] Warby-kun~: the sin was creating a flame.
[20-08-2014 03:53:39] Warby-kun~: NOOOOOOO.
[20-08-2014 03:53:45] Warby-kun~: that would ruin it.
[20-08-2014 03:54:09] calek01: I'm just saying add some significance to the bosses I'm fighting instead of stumbling upon them, killing them, and go "no idea what that was about"
[20-08-2014 03:54:26] Warby-kun~: they are significant though
[20-08-2014 03:54:40] calek01: like all the item descriptions and whatnot, that's lore, that's background information they should not be telling the actual plot of the game
[20-08-2014 03:54:48] Warby-kun~: you just need to read every single item description and talk to everyone completely
[20-08-2014 03:54:53] calek01: like DS2, I needed to watch videos to even get what happened throughout the game
[20-08-2014 03:55:02] Warby-kun~: you're so lame. geez.
[20-08-2014 03:55:07] Warby-kun~: it's more interesting this way.
[20-08-2014 03:55:16] Warby-kun~: it's like uncovering secrets.
[20-08-2014 03:55:18] calek01: the souls games suck at telling their story, Metroid Prime did it much better
[20-08-2014 03:56:04] Warby-kun~: it's like you're looking at ancient hieroglyphs and you need to read really long and hard to get it
[20-08-2014 03:56:13] Warby-kun~: but when you do it's really satisfying!
[20-08-2014 03:56:14] calek01: that's dumb
[20-08-2014 03:56:29] Warby-kun~: it's like the Souls games in general!
[20-08-2014 03:57:02] Warby-kun~: acquiring the information about the world and the plot is parallel to the gameplay
[20-08-2014 03:57:05] Warby-kun~: it's genius
[20-08-2014 03:57:38] calek01: information about the world gathered from items and whatever is fine, that's lore, that's background information to supplement the plot, but when you have to do the same thing for the plot is just bad writing
[20-08-2014 03:57:51] Warby-kun~: it's not bad WRITING
[20-08-2014 03:57:58] Warby-kun~: it's uh
[20-08-2014 03:57:59] calek01: bad presentation then sorry
[20-08-2014 03:58:08] Warby-kun~: not congruent to the typical gamer mindset
[20-08-2014 03:58:13] Warby-kun~: much like the gameplay
[20-08-2014 03:58:40] Warby-kun~: they're not going to hand plot to you on a silver platter
[20-08-2014 03:58:43] Warby-kun~: you gotta work for it
[20-08-2014 03:58:44] calek01: like the primal bonfires or the lord souls or the arch demons, having a cutscene after those fights would have added quite a bit
[20-08-2014 03:58:53] Warby-kun~: you're silly
[20-08-2014 03:58:57] Warby-kun~: why would they do that?
[20-08-2014 03:58:58] calek01: you're face is silly
[20-08-2014 03:59:22] Warby-kun~: you gotta work for your plot just as hard as you have to work for your victories
[20-08-2014 03:59:23] calek01: because competent narrative?
[20-08-2014 03:59:28] Warby-kun~: all things aside
[20-08-2014 03:59:41] Warby-kun~: EVERYTHING you find out is backstory
[20-08-2014 04:00:00] Warby-kun~: there's no PLOT besides the fact that you're the chosen undead and need to kill the dude to win
[20-08-2014 04:00:03] Warby-kun~: or "win"
[20-08-2014 04:00:20] Warby-kun~: because both endings in DS1 are DIRE
[20-08-2014 04:00:30] calek01: dark ending best ending
[20-08-2014 04:00:35] calek01: screw the gods, they did nothing for me
[20-08-2014 04:00:45] Warby-kun~: they're both dark endings
[20-08-2014 04:00:48] calek01: Manus is my anti-drug
[20-08-2014 04:00:50] Stuff-chan~: *farts*
[20-08-2014 04:01:00] Warby-kun~: you either put out the bonfire and kill EVERYONE
[20-08-2014 04:01:12] Warby-kun~: or leave it and extend their suffering
[20-08-2014 04:01:18] calek01: they don't die, they just don't come back to life
[20-08-2014 04:01:22] Warby-kun~: yes
[20-08-2014 04:01:23] Warby-kun~: so
[20-08-2014 04:01:24] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Stuff, it didn't work. Fart louder!
[20-08-2014 04:01:27] Warby-kun~: in a world like that
[20-08-2014 04:01:30] calek01: the ones who are already alive stay alive
[20-08-2014 04:01:32] Warby-kun~: they're basically dead
[20-08-2014 04:02:02] Warby-kun~: except for the big guys
[20-08-2014 04:02:03] Warby-kun~: they're fine
[20-08-2014 04:02:26] calek01: I like how people say Dark Souls 2 took a big dump on the lore
[20-08-2014 04:02:30] calek01: I think it made it more interesting
[20-08-2014 04:02:39] Warby-kun~: uh...
[20-08-2014 04:02:47] Warby-kun~: I don't think it took a dump on it
[20-08-2014 04:02:54] Warby-kun~: considering it takes place after
[20-08-2014 04:03:02] Warby-kun~: the gameplay and designs did though
[20-08-2014 04:03:23] calek01: hitboxes and I-Frames were done much worse
[20-08-2014 04:03:31] Warby-kun~: it's not that
[20-08-2014 04:03:33] Warby-kun~: it's like
[20-08-2014 04:03:47] Warby-kun~: Royal Rat Vanguard = shittier version of Sif
[20-08-2014 04:03:55] calek01: I will never do that fight again
[20-08-2014 04:04:01] Warby-kun~: exactly
[20-08-2014 04:04:14] calek01: most of the bosses being giant humanoids with sword and shields
[20-08-2014 04:04:26] calek01: level designs making you go in a straight line
[20-08-2014 04:04:30] Warby-kun~: the Sif fight was GREAT because you felt AWFUL
[20-08-2014 04:04:38] Warby-kun~: who the fuck cares about a rat
[20-08-2014 04:05:43] calek01: the actual fight with the rat was awful because of those plague inducing little rats, the giant one is ezpz without them

[20-08-2014 07:17:55] Calek Albion: site is down though which makes me sad
[20-08-2014 07:18:17] Stuff-chan~: Weh
[20-08-2014 07:18:22] Stuff-chan~: What comics?
[20-08-2014 07:18:28] Stuff-chan~: I think I shall read
[20-08-2014 07:19:56] Calek Albion: misfile, gunnerkrigg, ctrl-alt-delete, least I could do, questionable content, pictures for you, sinfest, shortpacked, dumbing of age, menage a three, blasternation, two guys and a guy, fanboys online
[20-08-2014 07:20:25] Stuff-chan~: Which was the one you posted
[20-08-2014 07:20:31] Calek Albion: two guys and a guy
[20-08-2014 07:20:47] Stuff-chan~: Kk
[20-08-2014 07:21:32] Calek Albion: fanboys online rarely updates because the guy who makes it also does work for an online gaming show thing
[20-08-2014 07:21:39] Calek Albion: forget the name, completely escapes me
[20-08-2014 07:30:19] Stuff-chan~: Lol my mood just crashed
[20-08-2014 07:30:34] Stuff-chan~: Basically I went to a filming for a show I love
[20-08-2014 07:30:53] Warby-kun~: C-Calek
[20-08-2014 07:30:57] Stuff-chan~: And I could have been on the show, but my friend took a huge hissy fit and made me leave with her
[20-08-2014 07:31:01] Warby-kun~: did you recommend CAD?
[20-08-2014 07:31:05] Stuff-chan~: One of the other people I was with
[20-08-2014 07:31:06] Warby-kun~: in all honesty?
[20-08-2014 07:31:08 | Edited 07:31:15] Stuff-chan~: Got on the show
[20-08-2014 07:31:19] Stuff-chan~: ...I'm just gonna...
[20-08-2014 07:31:20] Calek Albion: aww that sucks
[20-08-2014 07:31:41] Calek Albion: [20. august 2014 07:31] Warby-kun~: 

<<< did you recommend CAD?take a second look at the conversation and take it literally
[20-08-2014 07:32:30] Calek Albion: I never said it was my favourite, or that I recommend, just that I read it
[20-08-2014 07:32:45] Calek Albion: is it fantastic? don't care just read it out of habit at this point
[20-08-2014 07:33:11] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I sorry to hear what happened, Stuff :c
[20-08-2014 07:33:17] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (hug)
[20-08-2014 07:33:21] Warby-kun~: but
[20-08-2014 07:33:24] Warby-kun~: it's so bad...
[20-08-2014 07:33:30] Calek Albion: [20. august 2014 07:32] Calek Albion: 

<<< is it fantastic? don't care just read it out of habit at this point
[20-08-2014 07:34:27] Warby-kun~: granted, not as bad as VG Cats making Navi jokes ten years after the fact.
[20-08-2014 07:34:30] Warby-kun~: but still.
[20-08-2014 07:35:01] Calek Albion: the shift of focus to the "Player" characters improved it imo
[20-08-2014 07:35:11] Calek Albion: getting rid of Ethan and whoever else was a smart move
[20-08-2014 07:35:53] Warby-kun~: Tim Buckley is literally one of the worst people ever tho
[20-08-2014 07:37:08 | Edited 07:37:09] Calek Albion: I wouldn't know
[20-08-2014 07:37:56] Hiroko-imouto~: That's a shame to hear, Stuff. : x
[20-08-2014 07:37:56] Warby-kun~: he sent a dick pic to an autistic minor.
[20-08-2014 07:38:08] Warby-kun~: his dick had her name on it. :T
[20-08-2014 07:38:38] Calek Albion: I see
[20-08-2014 07:38:53] Warby-kun~: not like
[20-08-2014 07:39:01] Warby-kun~: metaphorically
[20-08-2014 07:39:05] Warby-kun~: literally
[20-08-2014 07:39:25] Calek Albion: I don't see how it would be
[20-08-2014 07:39:37] Warby-kun~: he has also blatantly stolen character designs
[20-08-2014 07:39:44] Warby-kun~: and been apprehended for IRL theft
[20-08-2014 07:39:50] Calek Albion: are you trying to convince me not to read it
[20-08-2014 07:39:54] Warby-kun~: no
[20-08-2014 07:39:58] Warby-kun~: just educating
[20-08-2014 07:40:11] Warby-kun~: it'd be great if you stopped supporting the comic tho
[20-08-2014 07:40:19] Calek Albion: probably won't happen
[20-08-2014 07:41:29] Warby-kun~: Jeph Jacques is a saint tho. keep supporting QC.
[20-08-2014 07:41:56] Calek Albion: don't know what he does either
[20-08-2014 07:42:02] Warby-kun~: ...
[20-08-2014 07:42:07] Calek Albion: to make him a saint
[20-08-2014 07:42:12] Warby-kun~: oh
[20-08-2014 07:42:25] Warby-kun~: transgender/sexual representation
[20-08-2014 07:42:32] Calek Albion: oh
[20-08-2014 07:42:42] Warby-kun~: fighting extreme depression and anxiety while still getting comics out
[20-08-2014 07:42:47] Warby-kun~: he also does awesome music
[20-08-2014 07:43:00] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Okay, so 'Beginnings' (both parts) is one of my favorite episodes from TLOK
[20-08-2014 07:43:02] Calek Albion: he did a preview of one of the songs, it was pretty neat
[20-08-2014 07:43:14] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Beautiful episode(s)
[20-08-2014 07:43:20] Warby-kun~: he's the one webcomic guy that I am proud to have an autograph of
[20-08-2014 07:43:28] Hiroko-imouto~: *AHEM*
[20-08-2014 07:43:38] Calek Albion: I'd probably never get autographs
[20-08-2014 07:43:44] Warby-kun~: he also drew me a little Pintsize. uwu
[20-08-2014 07:44:03] Warby-kun~: I just look up to the dude a lot.
[20-08-2014 07:44:19] Warby-kun~: it has almost nothing to do with the comic.
[20-08-2014 07:46:21] Calek Albion: one thing I do like about QC though is that the representation it gives doesn't feel forced, lilke stories aren't going a certain way just to feel politcally correct or whatever, it's very natural
[20-08-2014 07:47:50] Warby-kun~: yes. QC is fantastic.
[20-08-2014 07:49:09] Calek Albion: I feel like if anyone else was writing it, I would have stopped reading a long time ago, like if they made each representation aspect a "very special episode"
[20-08-2014 07:58:31] Hiroko-imouto~: I'm going to bed. Night.
[20-08-2014 07:58:54] Calek Albion: toodles
[20-08-2014 08:08:05] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: G'night Ho-welp, she's gone u.u
[20-08-2014 09:31:20] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I just got back from seeing "Boyhood", twas interesting
[20-08-2014 09:35:39] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Oooo really want to see that movie
[20-08-2014 09:37:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Movie's been in production for 11 years
[20-08-2014 09:37:51] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Ya, I heard 12
[20-08-2014 09:37:51] Calek Albion: wow
[20-08-2014 09:37:58] Calek Albion: poster says 12
[20-08-2014 09:38:27] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Ya
[20-08-2014 09:38:30] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Pretty nifty concept
[20-08-2014 09:39:18] Calek Albion: I applaud their dedication
[20-08-2014 09:40:20] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yep, 2002-2013
[20-08-2014 09:43:28] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: It's a movie that's 'near-unanimous acclaim by critics'
[20-08-2014 09:43:33] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Reeeallly wanna watch
[20-08-2014 09:44:10] Calek Albion: I don't think it's my type of movie
[20-08-2014 09:46:09] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Oh? Well, that's fine.
[20-08-2014 09:47:06] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Also, watchin' Back to the Future. God damn is this movie great.
[20-08-2014 09:48:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: ... who puts their keys in the trunk? .-.
[20-08-2014 10:12:53] Tuor-onii-sama!~: time to play some gta 5, muthafuckas
[20-08-2014 10:13:46] Calek Albion: Saints Row 4 is better =3
[20-08-2014 10:14:00] Calek Albion: I'm kidding they're two completely different games
[20-08-2014 10:14:12] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I have heard that, ya
[20-08-2014 10:14:22] Tuor-onii-sama!~: like Saints Row is way crazier, zanier
[20-08-2014 10:15:27 | Edited 10:15:36] Calek Albion: Saints Row 1 was trying it's best to be a GTA clone, 2 turned up the goofyness a bit, 3 cranked the goofyness to 11 and then 4 went off the deep end and said "screw it, you're now the president of the united states and there's an alien invasion"
[20-08-2014 10:15:47] Tuor-onii-sama!~: amazing hahaha
[20-08-2014 10:16:58] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Good for them for realizing "we can't do GTA better than GTA, so let's put a spin on it"
[20-08-2014 10:17:15] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I wish more FPS's would accept that philosophy
[20-08-2014 10:17:26] Calek Albion: Timesplitters needs to make a comeback
[20-08-2014 10:17:52] Calek Albion: running around as a floating fridge throwing bricks at monkey's is too good to just throw away
[20-08-2014 10:18:52] Calek Albion: although stuff like that is strictly mutliplayer but the single player is pretty light hearted
[20-08-2014 10:50:28] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I love Timesplitters, such a cool game. Only played the 2nd one but it's a great game.
[20-08-2014 16:00:00] Male The  Grape Ape: Saints Row 2 is best Saints Row
[20-08-2014 18:30:14] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: WAKE UP

[20-08-2014 18:32:31] Hiroko-imouto~: Not really, no. I might've been able to sleep another hour and a half or so, so...not much.
[20-08-2014 18:33:04] Hiroko-imouto~: Not sure why I had trouble sleeping, bleh.
[20-08-2014 18:33:22] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: :c aw

[20-08-2014 22:49:14] Karuama-oneechan~: I don't care if the game was basically just a glossy, glowy reimagining of an episode of batman the animated series, the shit was still amazing

[20-08-2014 22:58:12] Karuama-oneechan~: Hardly wrong at all.
[20-08-2014 22:58:33] Karuama-oneechan~: He can claim it's a dystopic view of a randian world all he wants
[20-08-2014 22:58:52] Karuama-oneechan~: It's just, that same dystopic world was already imagined in batman.
[20-08-2014 22:59:07] Karuama-oneechan~: Pretty sure it was under the sea too, lol
[20-08-2014 23:05:43] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Don't you dare insult Batman like that
[20-08-2014 23:05:49] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: comparing garbage to him... the nerve
[20-08-2014 23:06:09] Karuama-oneechan~: Pretty sure bioshock is far from garbage so you can just shut your face right now
[20-08-2014 23:06:21] Fummo-chan~: ya its not a blizzard title

[20-08-2014 23:07:50] Karuama-oneechan~: lrn to enjoy atmosphere, and not dislike things just because they were popular, gosh
[20-08-2014 23:08:18] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'm actually "disliking" it because it annoys you
[20-08-2014 23:08:24] Karuama-oneechan~: #rude

[20-08-2014 23:10:16] Karuama-oneechan~: It's about the game, not the camera
[20-08-2014 23:12:29] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Borderlands is the exception to the rule for me because... I play with the melee classes and it has rpg elements.
[20-08-2014 23:13:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Fuck aiming at things in online games where a split second lag makes all the difference.
[20-08-2014 23:13:32] Karuama-oneechan~: Guns, swords, buttslams, if it's fun it's fun

[20-08-2014 23:14:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: like Rainbow Mika does?
[20-08-2014 23:14:54] Karuama-oneechan~: Not sure, does she jump up, spread her legs, and land ass down in an adorable and deadly way?
[20-08-2014 23:15:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: she buttslams in different ways
[20-08-2014 23:15:11] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: that's her gimmick

[25-08-2014 05:45:39] calek01: it's a proper adaptation because the manga was finished before they started on it
[25-08-2014 05:45:50] calek01: hopefully they do the same to Soul Eater some day
[25-08-2014 05:47:30] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: The first one was being done while the manga wasn't finished, Exodis
[25-08-2014 05:47:38 | Edited 05:47:49] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so they pretty much ended up making a different anime
[25-08-2014 05:47:51] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Huh...
[25-08-2014 05:48:07] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Only the first season in both animes is the same
[25-08-2014 05:48:17] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: second season you start seeing vast changes
[25-08-2014 05:48:40] calek01: is it dubbed?

[25-08-2014 05:49:11] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: dubs are horrible
[25-08-2014 05:50:03] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: think it's the torrent with most seeders on piratebay
[25-08-2014 05:50:22] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Some dubs aren't horrible x:
[25-08-2014 05:50:33] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I don't like dubs, period
[25-08-2014 05:50:44] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I very much like watching things in their original language
[25-08-2014 05:53:49] thefighterofthenightman: I barely remember the first adaptation of the anime, except for the fact that the ending was a little shit

[25-08-2014 20:48:57] Riz-chaaan~: =___= nothing but stress so far
[25-08-2014 20:49:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: seems accurate
[25-08-2014 20:49:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: trip to london was nothing more than stress
[25-08-2014 20:53:29] Riz-chaaan~: this is BS
[25-08-2014 20:54:19] Stuff-chan~: You do have the worst luck with planes and stuff. But the wallet shit, jesus
[25-08-2014 20:54:50] Riz-chaaan~: whoever found it first took approximately half of the money in there
[25-08-2014 20:54:53] Riz-chaaan~: #canada
[25-08-2014 20:55:35] Riz-chaaan~: I also lost my notebook, the one I had like...everything in
[25-08-2014 20:55:46] Riz-chaaan~: that wasn't turned in
[25-08-2014 20:56:37] Stuff-chan~: How does someone steal a notebook?
[25-08-2014 20:56:55] Riz-chaaan~: I don't know, they must have saw the nude drawing inside it and decided to take it to beat off to
[25-08-2014 20:57:13] Riz-chaaan~: I had all my lists in there too, i'm quite unhappy.
[25-08-2014 20:57:21] Riz-chaaan~: but, LESS unhappy now
[25-08-2014 20:57:27] Wazit: you don't seem to have much luck on holidays
[25-08-2014 20:57:35] Riz-chaaan~: I should just take the hint and never leave home
[25-08-2014 20:57:50] Stuff-chan~: Lol I feel that way right now.
[25-08-2014 20:58:38] Stuff-chan~: I went to the Ren Faire, came home...found out Noah dropped ice cream on Bear. My Mom never cleaned it off, and I never noticed until today. He now has an infected hot spot and I need to take him to the vet at 4:20
[25-08-2014 20:58:49] Wazit: it's some time since you girls came to uk D:
[25-08-2014 20:59:20 | Edited 20:59:30] Riz-chaaan~: @johanna: wtf, ice cream did that?

@wazit: johanna was there more recently than I was
[25-08-2014 20:59:24] Stuff-chan~: Now they gotta shave his head, and give him antibiotics >>
[25-08-2014 20:59:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: We have no luck with animals, Stuff.
[25-08-2014 20:59:36] Stuff-chan~: It's cause his coat is so dense
[25-08-2014 20:59:49] Wazit: yeah but  that was about 2 years ago i think?
[25-08-2014 20:59:50] Stuff-chan~: Cause he has two coats. The top and bottom. Hence why he's a winter dog.
[25-08-2014 20:59:55] Wazit: i might have remembered wrongly
[25-08-2014 20:59:59] Stuff-chan~: 2012 was the last time I was there
[25-08-2014 21:00:08] Wazit: right on the mark!
[25-08-2014 21:00:09] Riz-chaaan~: I thought you were there in 2013....
[25-08-2014 21:00:18 | Edited 21:00:20] Riz-chaaan~: well w/e still true, i was there in 2011

[25-08-2014 21:00:44] Stuff-chan~: I might be going this spring, maybe
[25-08-2014 21:00:46] Wazit: yeah that was the one when i met grey i think
[25-08-2014 21:00:57] Riz-chaaan~: and you were supposed to meet me but we were too broke to get to london
[25-08-2014 21:00:59] Wazit: that saying whatever happened to him >.> <.<
[25-08-2014 21:01:03] Wazit: EXACTLY
[25-08-2014 21:01:11] Wazit: So we got a blow up doll in your name
[25-08-2014 21:01:12] Wazit: lol,

[25-08-2014 21:04:35] Stuff-chan~: I'm going to kill my mom
[25-08-2014 21:04:43] Stuff-chan~: I can't even leave my house for a day
[25-08-2014 21:04:56] Riz-chaaan~: are you going to be expected to cover this vet bill?
[25-08-2014 21:04:57] Stuff-chan~: 11-9 I was gone
[25-08-2014 21:05:03] Stuff-chan~: I have $50
[25-08-2014 21:05:15] Stuff-chan~: I told my Dad this, so I think he's gonna help me
[25-08-2014 21:05:33] Stuff-chan~: But my Mom is paying me back on Friday. I'm making her. This is ridiculous.
[25-08-2014 21:05:46] Stuff-chan~: This could have been avoided
[25-08-2014 21:06:25] Riz-chaaan~: unbelievable
[25-08-2014 21:08:26] Stuff-chan~: And now he's gonna be bald
[25-08-2014 21:08:44] Riz-chaaan~: poor baby
[25-08-2014 21:08:50] Stuff-chan~: On an antibiotic, and probably gonna have to put cream or something on his head
[25-08-2014 21:08:56] Stuff-chan~: I need to find a real job and leave
[25-08-2014 21:09:01] Stuff-chan~: I'm so tired of this shit
[25-08-2014 21:09:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: won't that kinda shit follow you anyway?
[25-08-2014 21:09:41] Stuff-chan~: Not if I move to where I wanna be. That dog is gonna be healthy as shit.
[25-08-2014 21:13:33] Riz-chaaan~: do you know if Bear is okay around kitties, if you lived with me there would be a kitty or two
[25-08-2014 21:13:41] Stuff-chan~: No idea
[25-08-2014 21:13:51] Stuff-chan~: They'd probably have to be slowly introduced
[25-08-2014 21:13:56] Stuff-chan~: But I think it'll be fine
[25-08-2014 21:14:05] Stuff-chan~: He's nothing but a big love bug
[25-08-2014 21:14:16] Stuff-chan~: Though, I'm sure if I was being attacked...
[25-08-2014 21:15:02] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: He'd attack much like Chucky attacked my cousin
[25-08-2014 21:15:32] Stuff-chan~: I dunno what that means
[25-08-2014 21:15:46] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: He'd defend you
[25-08-2014 21:15:49] Stuff-chan~: Okay lol

[25-08-2014 21:28:32] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Let's hope for the best! (yn)
[25-08-2014 21:28:39] Riz-chaaan~: suppose i could check the office supplies section, maybe it got "put back"
[25-08-2014 21:28:56] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: And I thought all Canadians were nice... ay.

Which silent hill?
[29-08-2014 08:19:27] Warby-kun~: the only reason that the remake isn't qualified as good is because it's not "HD"

Nintendo is really good about releasing handhelds that are slightly different/better so that you will be tempted to upgrade
[29-08-2014 18:27:19] Riz-chaaan~: Like when they released the XL, they knew they were going to from the beginning but wanted as many people as possible to buy the regular one first
[29-08-2014 18:35:11] Fummo-chan~: also what is this? a joystick for ants?!
[29-08-2014 18:38:18] Riz-chaaan~: its so silly
[29-08-2014 18:57:29] Riz-chaaan~: i'm definitely going to pay 300 dollars for a slightly bigger 3DS XL with a little joystick
[29-08-2014 18:58:43] Fummo-chan~: me to
[29-08-2014 18:59:00] Fummo-chan~: for monster hunter
[29-08-2014 19:28:13] Warby-kun~: hm
[29-08-2014 19:28:27] Warby-kun~: the joystick is useful for maybe
[29-08-2014 19:28:29] Warby-kun~: TWO GAMES
[29-08-2014 19:28:35] Warby-kun~: on the entire console
[29-08-2014 19:29:21] Warby-kun~: so rather than release the the peripheral in the west they're gonna release a whole new system that costs more?
[29-08-2014 19:31:02] Warby-kun~: the buttons have colours tho
[29-08-2014 19:31:07] Warby-kun~: that's worth it
[29-08-2014 19:32:40] Riz-chaaan~: so purdy
[29-08-2014 19:32:45] Male The  Grape Ape: In situations like these I'd always sell my console to get the new "advanced" version.
[29-08-2014 19:33:01] Riz-chaaan~: and get a shit price for it
[29-08-2014 19:33:16] Riz-chaaan~: i don't even want the new one, nintendo can keep it
[29-08-2014 19:33:18] Male The  Grape Ape: ...yeah...
[29-08-2014 19:33:45 | Edited 19:33:53] Male The  Grape Ape: But that's kinda how I got the gba sp and I had no regrets!
[29-08-2014 19:34:18] Male The  Grape Ape: Now THAT was a worthy update
[29-08-2014 19:36:13] Warby-kun~: I actually like the GBA more
[29-08-2014 19:36:32] Warby-kun~: the SP had a backlight tho and that made the shitty design worth it
[29-08-2014 19:39:00] Fummo-chan~: I will buy it if I can sell my 3DS
[29-08-2014 19:39:20] Fummo-chan~: They might release more games that require the second stick
[29-08-2014 19:39:36] Riz-chaaan~: Eh, wait and see
[29-08-2014 19:40:15] Fummo-chan~: yarp
[29-08-2014 19:41:56] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (sun)
[29-08-2014 19:45:10] Male The  Grape Ape: Oh hi
[29-08-2014 20:11:40] Male The  Grape Ape: I know what I want to do this Halloween...I will check out Sweet Home
[29-08-2014 20:15:15] Male The  Grape Ape: Sweet Home Alabama for the nes
[29-08-2014 20:46:26] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Screw that shit, I'm keeping my LoZ: ALBW 3DS and just buy the extra analog since it's way cheaper
[29-08-2014 21:10:43] Fummo-chan~: is the extra ne available for xl in the west?
[29-08-2014 21:10:59] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Yeah, Colev got it from a place in England
[29-08-2014 21:11:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: of course, they ship it from Japan
[29-08-2014 21:11:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: just search for it on amazon
[29-08-2014 21:11:24] Fummo-chan~: yeah it may be best since this thing doesnt sell well secondhand
[29-08-2014 21:11:37] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: that thing is huge for the XL
[29-08-2014 21:11:38 | Edited 21:11:43] Fummo-chan~: so its not region based?
[29-08-2014 21:11:52] Fummo-chan~: I have an xl sadly
[29-08-2014 21:12:11] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so do I and I regret nothing
[29-08-2014 21:12:11] Fummo-chan~: I dont think I could play monster hunter on a tiny screen
[29-08-2014 21:12:17] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: same
[29-08-2014 21:12:24] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I've seen Colev's game
[29-08-2014 21:12:34] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: the 3D is really cool on MH3U
[29-08-2014 21:13:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and what you mean by region based?
[29-08-2014 21:13:32] Calek Albion: region locked
[29-08-2014 21:14:04] Fummo-chan~: ^
[29-08-2014 21:14:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's an add-on
[29-08-2014 21:14:32] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I don't think those can be region locked
[29-08-2014 21:49:41] Calek Albion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM1cqRvIdmQ oh my yes
[29-08-2014 22:55:41] Stuff-chan~: Bought pretzel buns for burgers tomorrow

[29-08-2014 23:06:37] Riz-chaaan~: now i can take out some goddamn cash
[29-08-2014 23:06:42] Calek Albion: huzzah!
[29-08-2014 23:07:15] Riz-chaaan~: it apparently got here yesterday but the people here were confused because it said my name AND the hotel name so they opened it
[29-08-2014 23:07:21] Riz-chaaan~: (there's a language barrier)
[29-08-2014 23:08:15] Riz-chaaan~: now i'm going to go back to Target today and see if my notebook turned up...if it did, then this vacation will have gone almost okay
[29-08-2014 23:10:54] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (yn)
[29-08-2014 23:23:50] Riz-chaaan~: i am celebrating with food because i've been basically living off of snacks that i brought and leftover chow mein from my first day
[29-08-2014 23:24:06] Riz-chaaan~: (and a burger that tuor awesomely paid for)
[29-08-2014 23:44:00] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Mmm burger
[29-08-2014 23:44:44] Warby-kun~: hey Liz
[29-08-2014 23:45:00] Riz-chaaan~: what
[29-08-2014 23:45:04] Warby-kun~: if you end up coming to the island at any point there's an awesome diner in Sooke called Mom's Diber
[29-08-2014 23:45:09] Warby-kun~: Diner*
[29-08-2014 23:45:14] Warby-kun~: they've got awesome food
[29-08-2014 23:45:42] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Mom makes great food :33
[29-08-2014 23:46:08] Riz-chaaan~: i doubt i'll be getting to the island since Pana lives there and came here instead
[29-08-2014 23:46:33] Warby-kun~: that's a shame
[29-08-2014 23:49:38] Calek Albion: http://www.movshare.net/video/ykzbsr4zx7n6u Unaired Pilot for the show Archer where Archer is replaced with a Velocipartor
[29-08-2014 23:50:33] Warby-kun~: I think I saw that somewhere. it's great.
[30-08-2014 00:15:54] Riz-chaaan~: i had a dream i met amy poehler
[30-08-2014 00:17:38] Riz-chaaan~: and something about a golf club
[30-08-2014 00:17:38] Artan: Was she nice?
[30-08-2014 00:17:49] Riz-chaaan~: she was super nice and laughed at whatever the golf club thing was about
[30-08-2014 00:18:30] Artan: This is a good dream
[30-08-2014 00:18:51] Riz-chaaan~: that's pretty much all i remember of the dream, and i only just now remembered it because i saw a picture of her
[30-08-2014 00:39:49] Calek Albion: I had a dream I was stuck in a Bioshock esque labrynth forced to defend myself from the splicers wiht a group of people
[30-08-2014 00:40:02] Calek Albion: there were traps and stuff set up and we were doing fine until they became invincible
[30-08-2014 00:40:07] Calek Albion: I died in the end
[30-08-2014 00:40:09] Riz-chaaan~: hax
[30-08-2014 00:41:14] Fummo-chan~: I had a dream I was holding my gun at an awkward angle while yelling 'streetwalkers carl!'
[30-08-2014 00:41:40] Calek Albion: it was kinda gross in the end too as one of the survivors was like "I know how they're finding us all the time, there are chips in our necks that we can cut out" and we were like "ok lets do that" and he was like "lol I was lying" and just dragged the knife through someone's spine
[30-08-2014 00:42:15] Fummo-chan~: do a kickstarter
[30-08-2014 00:42:17] Calek Albion: that was the invincible guy too, it sucked, my dream cheated
[30-08-2014 00:42:31] Calek Albion: I was winning >_<
[30-08-2014 00:43:13] Calek Albion: and I think I was left handed
[30-08-2014 00:45:12] Artan: holy shit dudes i just put on my glasses for the first time in like a year
[30-08-2014 00:45:14] Artan: it feels
[30-08-2014 00:45:14] Artan: strange

[30-08-2014 00:45:49] Calek Albion: I like it
[30-08-2014 00:45:52] Calek Albion: it has snes colours
[30-08-2014 00:45:53] Calek Albion: I want it
[30-08-2014 00:46:19] Vegedus-dono~: I bought my damn 3ds xl half a year ago and now it's soon to be outdated :|
[30-08-2014 00:46:19] Calek Albion: plus it's like the Gameboy Colour of 3DS'
[30-08-2014 00:46:22] Fummo-chan~: I'm just mad because I dont want to pay for a shitty strap on
[30-08-2014 00:46:22] Hiroko-imouto~: Nintendo's revenge for the leaks.
[30-08-2014 00:46:31] Calek Albion: better RAM and CPU
[30-08-2014 00:46:52] Vegedus-dono~: So some titles will be exclusive to it. So you can't just ignore it.
[30-08-2014 00:46:54] Riz-chaaan~: i don't notice any need for more RAM or CPU right now so it would be imperceptible
[30-08-2014 00:47:01] Fummo-chan~: they're going over board with the amount of 3DS's
[30-08-2014 00:47:12] Fummo-chan~: too many
[30-08-2014 00:47:17] Calek Albion: it's the same amount of DS and Gameboys and Gameboy Advances
[30-08-2014 00:47:17] Fummo-chan~: in such a short time
[30-08-2014 00:47:26] Fummo-chan~: they arent cheap man
[30-08-2014 00:47:48] Riz-chaaan~: i think i'll probably survive without one, any exclusive games would probably be ones i woudln't want anyway
[30-08-2014 00:47:53] Vegedus-dono~: In the same swoop they've also announced a port of Xenoblade that will be availiable only on the new 3ds.
[30-08-2014 00:47:56] Fummo-chan~: and monster hunter 4 is the only thing worth paying
[30-08-2014 00:48:15 | Edited 00:48:17] Calek Albion: oh and two more shoulder buttons, forgot about that
[30-08-2014 00:48:18] Vegedus-dono~: I've already played that, so it's not specifically a problem, but I can only fear for what I'll miss out on...
[30-08-2014 00:48:49] Fummo-chan~: my point is they need to announce games that need 2 joysticks...
[30-08-2014 00:48:54] Riz-chaaan~: [30. august 2014 00:48] Calek Albion: 

<<< oh and two more shoulder buttons, forgot about thatdidn't playstation do that first
[30-08-2014 00:49:04] Fummo-chan~: not just go here have an extra one for the pile of games that dont require it
[30-08-2014 00:49:10] Vegedus-dono~: [30. august 2014 00:47] Calek Albion: 

<<< it's the same amount of DS and Gameboys and Gameboy AdvancesI doubt it's in the same amount of time though.
[30-08-2014 00:49:22] Fummo-chan~: one stick is so 2005

[30-08-2014 00:49:34] Riz-chaaan~: GET YOUR OWN IDEAS NINTENDO GOSH
[30-08-2014 00:49:50] Riz-chaaan~: I know i've played some system with L1, L2, R1, R2
[30-08-2014 00:49:51] Vegedus-dono~: The gamecube had two shoulder buttons on, err, one side.
[30-08-2014 00:50:03] Calek Albion: that darn Z button
[30-08-2014 00:50:04] Riz-chaaan~: that was just for the Z button to be in a better place
[30-08-2014 00:50:11] Riz-chaaan~: rather than being a trigger button
[30-08-2014 00:50:32] Fummo-chan~: maybe this version will one day be used as an alternative to the wii U controller?
[30-08-2014 00:50:38] Fummo-chan~: kinda like the PSVITA
[30-08-2014 00:50:39] Riz-chaaan~: dream big
[30-08-2014 00:50:40] Vegedus-dono~: Wait, does the Wii U only have one set of shoulder buttons?
[30-08-2014 00:50:41] Fummo-chan~: is to the ps4
[30-08-2014 00:50:54] Calek Albion: yup just one set, only R1 and R2
[30-08-2014 00:51:06] Calek Albion: (it has two)
[30-08-2014 00:51:23] Fummo-chan~: they going to announce an economical console next year apparently
[30-08-2014 00:51:23] Riz-chaaan~: so two shoulder buttons...but on one shoulder
[30-08-2014 00:52:09 | Edited 00:52:11] Vegedus-dono~: Huh, the Wii u controller has two. It's pretty much an Xbox controller.

[30-08-2014 08:54:14 | Edited 08:54:18] Sefrol-kuuun~: about this girl who falls in love with a shojo manga artist and the humor is kinda dry
[30-08-2014 08:54:59] Sefrol-kuuun~: But it's been a while since I've gotten into anything with dry humor, so it feels refreshing
[30-08-2014 08:57:27] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Animus and mangoes

[30-08-2014 12:56:49] Karuama-oneechan~: All y'all crazy ass mo'fos best not be sleepin'
[30-08-2014 12:57:14] Vegedus-dono~: Not all, no. Some are just getting up.
[30-08-2014 12:57:29] Karuama-oneechan~: No wonder I called ya crazy
[30-08-2014 12:57:41] Karuama-oneechan~: That's just bananas mang, get that shit fixed
[30-08-2014 12:58:43] Vegedus-dono~: What, my time zone?
[30-08-2014 12:58:48] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeah.
[30-08-2014 12:58:50] Vegedus-dono~: The earth's rotation?
[30-08-2014 12:58:54] Karuama-oneechan~: Lead a revolution
[30-08-2014 12:59:01] Karuama-oneechan~: Produce a second sun.
[30-08-2014 12:59:23] Karuama-oneechan~: Our lives shall be lead in a balance of day and twilight
[30-08-2014 13:00:02] Karuama-oneechan~: And firey death, but that can be ignored, fix your damned timezone
[30-08-2014 13:00:02] Vegedus-dono~: And never sleep
[30-08-2014 13:00:18] Vegedus-dono~: YOU should fix your time zone.
[30-08-2014 13:00:19] Karuama-oneechan~: You can sleep during the day. (worry)
[30-08-2014 13:00:35] Vegedus-dono~: I'm much closer to GMT +0, the REAL time zone, than you
[30-08-2014 13:00:58] Karuama-oneechan~: Oh?
[30-08-2014 13:01:00] Vegedus-dono~: Americuh doesn't even have just one time zone, so it would be nonsensical to adhere to it!
[30-08-2014 13:01:22] Karuama-oneechan~: How can you judge me, you don't even know if I'm on pacific, or mountain time at the moment.
[30-08-2014 13:01:42] Vegedus-dono~: Can you beat GMT +1?
[30-08-2014 13:01:44] Vegedus-dono~: I THINK NOT
[30-08-2014 13:01:55] Karuama-oneechan~: PRETTY SURE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT GMT
[30-08-2014 13:02:11] Karuama-oneechan~: PRETTY SURE THAT JUST STANDS FOR 'GOAT MEKKING TRASH'
[30-08-2014 13:02:45] Vegedus-dono~: Right, as always your national arrogance disguised as patriotism results in you making your own damn systems
[30-08-2014 13:03:05] Karuama-oneechan~: I'm not patriotic though. :V
[30-08-2014 13:03:15] Karuama-oneechan~: Arrogant, sure.
[30-08-2014 13:03:46] Vegedus-dono~: "Ooooh, I have pacific time, not GMT -7. GMT is for the rest of the world, like terrorists and north koreans, amirite?"
[30-08-2014 13:04:03] Karuama-oneechan~: As always, your belief in the universality of american stereotype has blinded you to the fact that west coast is in fact, best coast
[30-08-2014 13:04:26] Karuama-oneechan~: Also, I have pacific, AND mountain
[30-08-2014 13:04:47] Karuama-oneechan~: We don't even adhere to time savings here.
[30-08-2014 13:05:20 | Edited 13:06:03] Vegedus-dono~: "West coast is best coast" Why would I care? What do you know or care about the danish west coast?
[30-08-2014 13:05:25] Vegedus-dono~: NATIONAL ARROGANCE
[30-08-2014 13:05:41] Karuama-oneechan~: THE DANISH WEST COAST ISN'T MY WEST COAST
[30-08-2014 13:06:00] Karuama-oneechan~: It's not an issue of nations, it's an issue of IDEPENDANT arrogance
[30-08-2014 13:06:15] Vegedus-dono~: AH, okay, I feel ya.
[30-08-2014 13:06:19] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeah bruh
[30-08-2014 13:06:26] Karuama-oneechan~: Also, fuck yo west coast
[30-08-2014 13:06:43] Vegedus-dono~: I'm technically at the east coast, so yeah
[30-08-2014 13:06:53] Karuama-oneechan~: East coast LEAST coast
[30-08-2014 13:07:15] Vegedus-dono~: Though that's not really how we divide the country, we're all about which piece of land or island you're on.
[30-08-2014 13:07:40] Karuama-oneechan~: What, like territories or states?
[30-08-2014 13:08:37] Vegedus-dono~: Well, our country consists of one part mainland attached to goddamn germany, two big isles and a smattering of small ones, too small to consider
[30-08-2014 13:09:08] Vegedus-dono~: The three aren't independent states or anything, that would be silly in a country this small, but they have their own names and to a certain degree, culture.
[30-08-2014 13:09:27] Karuama-oneechan~: Ah, well okay
[30-08-2014 13:10:23] Karuama-oneechan~: Sounds pretty similar to our states. Just, without all the arguments over gun rights and gay marriage.
[30-08-2014 13:11:01] Vegedus-dono~: Yeh, none of that.
[30-08-2014 13:11:17] Vegedus-dono~: Not even a debate.
[30-08-2014 13:12:04] Karuama-oneechan~: I'd imagine our country changes slower than yours, but I'm grateful for states making their own laws to some extent
[30-08-2014 13:12:41] Karuama-oneechan~: Emphasis on some (worry)
[30-08-2014 13:13:00] Vegedus-dono~: Uhuh.
[30-08-2014 13:13:23] Vegedus-dono~: There's nothing wrong with the concept of state laws, except that some of your states have some dumb-ass laws
[30-08-2014 13:13:34] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeeeeahp
[30-08-2014 13:13:57] Vegedus-dono~: But hey, you've legalized marijuana before we did, somehow!
[30-08-2014 13:15:05] Karuama-oneechan~: I see a bunch of those medical marijuana evaluation centers around town, along with "maui smoke shops" E-cig stores, and hooka lounges, it's getting silly
[30-08-2014 13:16:01] Karuama-oneechan~: OH, and some bus stop benches have this image of a red marijuana leaf saying "Think marijuana's harmless? THINK AGAIN"
[30-08-2014 13:16:17] Vegedus-dono~: Mmm, good argument.
[30-08-2014 13:16:25] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeah, I'm convinced
[30-08-2014 13:16:53] Karuama-oneechan~: Your red leaf totally makes me think of how scary pot is, and not how much it looks like a japanese tree
[30-08-2014 13:17:14] Vegedus-dono~: Or Canada :D
[30-08-2014 13:17:35] Karuama-oneechan~: lol, nah, the leaves are too thin to make me think of maple
[30-08-2014 13:18:44] Vegedus-dono~: That's what they want you to think
[30-08-2014 13:18:53] Vegedus-dono~: Them Canadians, always tokin'
[30-08-2014 13:18:54] Karuama-oneechan~: Oh, it is maple... Just japanese maple. Also, I think they may have used one of these images...
[30-08-2014 13:19:21] Karuama-oneechan~: No wonder it's so chill-y up there.
[30-08-2014 13:19:24] Karuama-oneechan~: huehue
[30-08-2014 13:19:50] Karuama-oneechan~: Oh yeah, what do you call it when you slap someone's face with a sticker?
[30-08-2014 13:21:07] Vegedus-dono~: Uh, being rude and sorta violent?
[30-08-2014 13:21:15] Karuama-oneechan~: Graphic violence
[30-08-2014 13:21:50] Karuama-oneechan~: Whaddya call a chart of variously sized and coloured bowed instruments?
[30-08-2014 13:22:38] Vegedus-dono~: Barytone graph?
[30-08-2014 13:22:47] Karuama-oneechan~: Graphic violins
[30-08-2014 13:22:51] Karuama-oneechan~: :D
[30-08-2014 13:22:57] Vegedus-dono~: Uggggggghhhhhhhhhh
[30-08-2014 13:23:01] Karuama-oneechan~: :D
[30-08-2014 13:23:50] Karuama-oneechan~: I asked someone about the sticker slap 9 days ago.
[30-08-2014 13:24:01] Karuama-oneechan~: And only told them the punchline today.
[30-08-2014 13:24:16] Vegedus-dono~: I'm sure the wait only made the joke dumber.
[30-08-2014 13:24:22] Karuama-oneechan~: Oh yes.
[30-08-2014 13:24:30] Karuama-oneechan~: They even asked friends of theirs
[30-08-2014 13:24:34] Karuama-oneechan~: But no one guessed
[30-08-2014 13:25:08] Karuama-oneechan~: Truly, my puns are my most american trait, because I DON'T CARE IF YOU LAUGH
[30-08-2014 13:28:05] Vegedus-dono~: I think most people who are into puns wouldn't. Because it would be a fool's errand.
[30-08-2014 13:28:48] Karuama-oneechan~: Probably true, we seek other responses.
[30-08-2014 13:29:12] Vegedus-dono~: It's sadistic urge, really.
[30-08-2014 13:29:26] Vegedus-dono~: You sick fucks disgust me!
[30-08-2014 13:29:41] Karuama-oneechan~: HUEHUE DEAL WITH IT SCRUB
[30-08-2014 13:30:02] Vegedus-dono~: Knock knock.
[30-08-2014 13:30:10] Karuama-oneechan~: Who dat?
[30-08-2014 13:30:15] Vegedus-dono~: GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE
[30-08-2014 13:30:41] Karuama-oneechan~: SORRY STILL BANGIN' YOUR WIFE, CAN'T
[30-08-2014 13:31:02] Vegedus-dono~: OH, DON'T TEST ME SON I'LL KICK THIS DOOR DOWN YOU LITTLE SHIT
[30-08-2014 13:31:19] Vegedus-dono~: HEARD OF 'STAND YOUR GROUND' BITCH?
[30-08-2014 13:31:51] Karuama-oneechan~: I HAVE BUT THANKFULLY NEITHER OF US LIVE IN THE FLACID COCK OF AMERICA KNOWN AS FLORIDA
[30-08-2014 13:32:25] Vegedus-dono~: YOU DON'T DECIDE WHERE I LIVE BUDDY
[30-08-2014 13:32:37] Karuama-oneechan~: YOU LIVE IN DANE-LAND
[30-08-2014 13:32:59] Karuama-oneechan~: I love your dogs and pastries and YOUR WIFE
[30-08-2014 13:33:25] Vegedus-dono~: Scandinavian blondes, unf
[30-08-2014 13:34:06] Karuama-oneechan~: Unf, well actually I prefer black girls, but your wife has been close to your dick so there's that.
[30-08-2014 13:38:08] Vegedus-dono~: Jungle fever, eh?
[30-08-2014 13:39:19] Karuama-oneechan~: I guess, colors pop on them, they tend to have larger lips, and their upbringing leans more towards outward personalities and an ability to sing
[30-08-2014 13:40:08] Karuama-oneechan~: All that crossed with a degree of nerdiness, and nice eyes and BAM perfection
[30-08-2014 13:42:48] Karuama-oneechan~: Of course there's also the junk in the trunk, unf~
[30-08-2014 13:45:40] Vegedus-dono~: An ability to sing?
[30-08-2014 13:46:01] Karuama-oneechan~: Yes?
[30-08-2014 13:46:59] Karuama-oneechan~: Church choir is still a pretty big part of black culture here
[30-08-2014 13:47:36] Karuama-oneechan~: Being taught to sing, and singing at a young age makes you more likely to be able to sing don't it?
[30-08-2014 13:48:04] Karuama-oneechan~: And at the very least, confident enough to do so.
[30-08-2014 13:48:24] Vegedus-dono~: I just didn't think it was *that* common
[30-08-2014 13:49:02] Karuama-oneechan~: I think it's fairly common, though kind of a stereotype.
[30-08-2014 13:49:30] Karuama-oneechan~: But meh, I don't know all that many black peeps
[30-08-2014 13:52:07] Vegedus-dono~: Black people around here are more often adopted (by white people) or first generation immigrants, so not that much culture.
[30-08-2014 13:53:16] Karuama-oneechan~: Do you have many africans dressing in the bright headdresses??
[30-08-2014 13:53:28] Vegedus-dono~: Never seen any
[30-08-2014 13:53:45] Karuama-oneechan~: Ah, we've got a bit of a community here
[30-08-2014 14:05:15] Karuama-oneechan~: Veggie, tell me about your game endeavors.
[30-08-2014 14:05:55 | Edited 14:06:19] Vegedus-dono~: Hrmm. Haven't worked on it a lot lately due to other projects, away-holiday and most of all: Dark Souls and Minecraft.
[30-08-2014 14:06:01] Vegedus-dono~: Doing, uh, research, right?
[30-08-2014 14:06:11] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeah bro. *wink*
[30-08-2014 14:06:25] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: get back on D3, Veg
[30-08-2014 14:06:36] Vegedus-dono~: There's still no part of it that's playable. Just a lot of foundation in place.
[30-08-2014 14:06:40] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: new major content patch has arrived, me, Dev and Asmo are having a blast
[30-08-2014 14:06:57] Karuama-oneechan~: That's probably a good sign
[30-08-2014 14:07:06] Karuama-oneechan~: But what kinda game is it gonna be?
[30-08-2014 14:08:00] Vegedus-dono~: An RPG. With a lil' bit of J in it, and probably some rogue-lite too.
[30-08-2014 14:08:30] Karuama-oneechan~: So isometric perspective?
[30-08-2014 14:08:49] Vegedus-dono~: Exploration, random encounters, with semi-real time combat, but with more focus on managing time, tactics and reflexes than wading through menus.
[30-08-2014 14:08:52] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah, I guess.
[30-08-2014 14:09:34] Karuama-oneechan~: Well that's fun, though you're more focused on code and design, do you have any plan in terms of art?
[30-08-2014 14:10:36] Vegedus-dono~: Not too much. I'm using FFVI sprites as placeholder for now. I know a couple of artists that have expressed interest, so I'll either call on them, or if the scope is low enough, do it myself.
[30-08-2014 14:10:48] Vegedus-dono~: I can do decent 2D if I put the effort in.
[30-08-2014 14:10:55] Karuama-oneechan~: Rad
[30-08-2014 14:11:24] Vegedus-dono~: But yeah, I'm much more concerned with design. Making sure the mechanics is fun comes way before art in my book.
[30-08-2014 14:11:55] Karuama-oneechan~: As it should, art's just the delivery system for games.
[30-08-2014 14:12:33] Vegedus-dono~: I've also a lot of experiencing designing tabletop roleplaying games, and play a decent amount of board games too, so rules and mechanics are my forté
[30-08-2014 14:12:48] Vegedus-dono~: I play most games in order to discover new mechanics.
[30-08-2014 14:13:03] Karuama-oneechan~: Sounds like your head's in the right place
[30-08-2014 14:13:09] Vegedus-dono~: I try.
[30-08-2014 14:13:19] Karuama-oneechan~: I'd like to see more games designed to be games, rather than vidyagaemz
[30-08-2014 14:13:36] Vegedus-dono~: Uh? As in board games?
[30-08-2014 14:14:02] Karuama-oneechan~: No, I mean it more broadly
[30-08-2014 14:14:26] Vegedus-dono~: Well, board games doesn't need literal boards, they're just always analogue.
[30-08-2014 14:14:33] Karuama-oneechan~: Video games are designed to fit into the box called videogames, rather than just being designed to be fun
[30-08-2014 14:14:52] Karuama-oneechan~: At least some of the time
[30-08-2014 14:15:12] Vegedus-dono~: Ah, right. Well, there's a lot of controversy of games trying to break out of that box. Like Dear Esther and Gone Home.
[30-08-2014 14:15:37] Vegedus-dono~: There's backlash when you don't follow the conventions of genre.
[30-08-2014 14:15:54] Karuama-oneechan~: Haven't played gone home, but dear esther didn't seem to be designed to be fun so much as it was designed to be atmospheric and pretty
[30-08-2014 14:16:09] Vegedus-dono~: I'd count that as a kind of fun.
[30-08-2014 14:16:23] Karuama-oneechan~: Ehhh, a painting doesn't count as fun
[30-08-2014 14:16:28] Vegedus-dono~: I think it's meaningless to distinguish between, as long as it's a positive experince.
[30-08-2014 14:16:48] Karuama-oneechan~: No way bro, you have to distinguish
[30-08-2014 14:16:55] Vegedus-dono~: Or at least, I'd rather have the goal of a positive experience, than fun, then.
[30-08-2014 14:17:53] Karuama-oneechan~: Well, if your goal is somthing fun, but strategic, you shouldn't put atmospheric and pretty as your top priority
[30-08-2014 14:18:11] Karuama-oneechan~: That's all the distinguishing that's needed
[30-08-2014 14:18:28] Vegedus-dono~: Sure. And I'm not sure I like those games, with my focus on mechanics, but there's nothing invalid about them, and they do try to not fit in the box.
[30-08-2014 14:18:43] Karuama-oneechan~: Definitely nothing invalid
[30-08-2014 14:19:10] Karuama-oneechan~: I hated the voice actor in dear esther, with his big dumb words, but it was still impressive when I played a bit
[30-08-2014 14:19:53] Karuama-oneechan~: And I love silent hill 1-3, which are all about the atmosphere
[30-08-2014 14:20:23] Karuama-oneechan~: But survival horror as a genre is a good example of a mismanagement of priorities
[30-08-2014 14:21:17] Karuama-oneechan~: They took series which were focused on slow gameplay, cramped environments, and lots of puzzles, and geared them towards shooting, and action.
[30-08-2014 14:22:27] Vegedus-dono~: Due more to trends in gaming and genres I think. It's not so much mismanagement of priorities as much as their priorities overtly changing, because of action games becoming more popular.
[30-08-2014 14:23:29] Karuama-oneechan~: And yet they're still sold as creepy spoopy horror
[30-08-2014 14:24:08] Vegedus-dono~: Cake, eat it too they are.
[30-08-2014 14:24:15] Karuama-oneechan~: Pretty much
[30-08-2014 14:24:34] Karuama-oneechan~: Amnesia actually did a straight take horror game, for this I was grateful
[30-08-2014 14:24:42] Vegedus-dono~: Keep the old fans, bringing in the new generation of 13 year olds.
[30-08-2014 14:24:48] Karuama-oneechan~: Old man dick was unnecessary though.
[30-08-2014 14:25:15] Karuama-oneechan~: I guess the 13 year old factor can't be discounted. :/
[30-08-2014 14:25:49] Vegedus-dono~: It cannot!
[30-08-2014 14:25:58] Vegedus-dono~: Consider we were once that old, being pandered to.
[30-08-2014 14:26:20] Karuama-oneechan~: But we were growing up around goosebumps, so we actually like spoopy stuff
[30-08-2014 14:26:29] Vegedus-dono~: I keep thinking writing in gaming is getting worse, but it's probably just me getting older and realizing they're still being written for teenagers.
[30-08-2014 14:27:14] Karuama-oneechan~: lol, writing and voice acting have come leaps and bounds I think
[30-08-2014 14:27:37] Vegedus-dono~: Probably, doesn't feel like it.
[30-08-2014 14:28:04] Karuama-oneechan~: I think it's universally better, so the actually good scripts don't have any room to shine
[30-08-2014 14:28:49] Vegedus-dono~: My main groaning is Bravely Default, which I'm playing through at the moment.
[30-08-2014 14:29:01] Karuama-oneechan~: Haven't played it
[30-08-2014 14:29:10] Vegedus-dono~: And it's so popular, and the story is so. Hm. Not dumb, just horribly structured.
[30-08-2014 14:29:44] Karuama-oneechan~: Well, it's not like games are a bastion for linear narrative
[30-08-2014 14:29:58] Karuama-oneechan~: It's just, it actually has story, and older games often didn't.
[30-08-2014 14:29:58] Vegedus-dono~: It's linear game, so that's no excuse
[30-08-2014 14:30:36] Vegedus-dono~: But I wouldn't be able to objectively appraise whether the stories of my childhood, Final Fantasy VI through X are actually better.
[30-08-2014 14:30:58] Karuama-oneechan~: Do you remember "the bouncer"?
[30-08-2014 14:31:06] Vegedus-dono~: Never played it.
[30-08-2014 14:31:19] Karuama-oneechan~: The game's story and voice acting were so fucked
[30-08-2014 14:31:37] Karuama-oneechan~: But I only found this out when I watched a let's play a while back
[30-08-2014 14:31:58] Vegedus-dono~: Well, that was also a low-budget spin-off thing.
[30-08-2014 14:32:24] Vegedus-dono~: Not that, say FF VII would have had good voice acting had it had it.
[30-08-2014 14:32:25] Karuama-oneechan~: I'm not one of those nerds saying that classics aren't that great and we're all nostalgia blinded, but we didn't have very good taste when we were younger
[30-08-2014 14:32:36] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah, super true.
[30-08-2014 14:32:51] Vegedus-dono~: [30. august 2014 14:32] Karuama-oneechan~: 

<<< I'm not one of those nerds saying that classics aren't that great and we're all nostalgia blindedI guess I am :P
[30-08-2014 14:32:55] Vegedus-dono~: Almost.
[30-08-2014 14:33:26] Karuama-oneechan~: That can often be true, I just dislike the blanket statement
[30-08-2014 14:36:55] Vegedus-dono~: YOU'RE a blanket stament.
[30-08-2014 14:37:06] Karuama-oneechan~: YOU'RE A NOSTALGIA
[30-08-2014 14:37:11] Vegedus-dono~: :O
[30-08-2014 14:37:15] Karuama-oneechan~: OOOOOHH
[30-08-2014 14:38:03] Vegedus-dono~: But yeah, looking over my steam library, there's certainly entries with stories better than anything we had 10 years ago.
[30-08-2014 14:38:21] Vegedus-dono~: And some that just have the same level of mediocrity.
[30-08-2014 14:39:02] Karuama-oneechan~: My steam is a bad judge, because it's full of multiplayer and shit
[30-08-2014 14:39:19] Karuama-oneechan~: But zeno clash comes to mind, and it had an amazing story
[30-08-2014 14:39:36] Vegedus-dono~: Really? I thought it was very much a non-story.
[30-08-2014 14:39:52] Karuama-oneechan~: Very minimalist, but many fairy tales are
[30-08-2014 14:39:58] Vegedus-dono~: Lots of omens, and an mysteries, but very little content.
[30-08-2014 14:40:05] Karuama-oneechan~: I agree
[30-08-2014 14:40:36] Vegedus-dono~: And the plot twist *spoiler!* of Father mother stealing the babies were too heavily forshadowed.
[30-08-2014 14:40:55] Karuama-oneechan~: Ehhh, I didn't see it comin'
[30-08-2014 14:41:08] Karuama-oneechan~: Mayhap I am just a dullard
[30-08-2014 14:41:11] Vegedus-dono~: WELL THAT'S JUST BECAUSE U AIN'T SMURT LIKE ME
[30-08-2014 14:41:24] Karuama-oneechan~: Did you catch it at the pig?
[30-08-2014 14:41:28] Vegedus-dono~: SO ALL YOUR ARGUEMENTS AN' OPINIONS ARE IINVALID
[30-08-2014 14:41:39] Vegedus-dono~: Yeah, I think so.
[30-08-2014 14:41:58] Karuama-oneechan~: At that point I was fearful that it was all gonna be a dream
[30-08-2014 14:42:04] Vegedus-dono~: Lul, hehe
[30-08-2014 14:42:10] Karuama-oneechan~: Or afterlife setting or some cop out bullshit
[30-08-2014 14:42:19] Karuama-oneechan~: But then it all clicked in place and I was like woooow
[30-08-2014 14:42:27] Vegedus-dono~: The black face dude was certainly mysterious enough that that was an option
[30-08-2014 14:42:55] Vegedus-dono~: I just figured he would eventually explain the origin of the world or the ties to us or whatever AND HE NEVER DID
[30-08-2014 14:43:09] Karuama-oneechan~: I could've died at the end of the world, and black face dude was the grim reaper, trying to calm my soul by solving my problem but not really
[30-08-2014 14:43:48] Vegedus-dono~: But Bravely Default has the same problem. Lots of mysteries, a few plot twists, but little content. Trouble is, it's a 80 hour long game!
[30-08-2014 14:43:55] Karuama-oneechan~: Ew
[30-08-2014 14:44:26] Vegedus-dono~: So every cutscene is someone hinting at a plot twist or secret of the setting that they won't reveal until 30 hours later!
[30-08-2014 14:44:27] Vegedus-dono~: GAH
[30-08-2014 14:44:40] Vegedus-dono~: Okay, 80 might be an exaggeration, but still
[30-08-2014 14:44:46] Karuama-oneechan~: Looking at the games I've played, I'm starting to think they've been tricking me.
[30-08-2014 14:45:00] Karuama-oneechan~: Modern games don't have as much engrish, and they have a plot
[30-08-2014 14:45:26] Karuama-oneechan~: This gives the impression that they've improved their writing, when in actuality, translation is cheaper, and hard drives are bigger
[30-08-2014 14:45:36] Karuama-oneechan~: Game writing sucks ass. :(
[30-08-2014 14:46:03] Vegedus-dono~: Lul.
[30-08-2014 14:46:18] Karuama-oneechan~: But, I stilll ike the story in a lot of games, zeno clash included suck a dick
[30-08-2014 14:46:49] Vegedus-dono~: Whu? You like that the story suck a dick?
[30-08-2014 14:47:10] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeah I like that story suck a dick
[30-08-2014 14:47:19] Karuama-oneechan~: Suck a dick is a great story bro
[30-08-2014 14:47:39] Vegedus-dono~: It's a fun activity, but not a great story, I think.
[30-08-2014 14:47:54] Vegedus-dono~: But I'm willing to be read slashfiction that proves otherwise.
[30-08-2014 14:47:59] Karuama-oneechan~: It's the best story in any mouth based videogame I've ever seen
[30-08-2014 14:48:02] Vegedus-dono~: I can't tell if western RPGs, Bioware and it's ilk in particularly, have gotten better. They were pretty decent to begin with.
[30-08-2014 14:48:21] Karuama-oneechan~: Mass effect 2 sucked ass
[30-08-2014 14:48:33] Karuama-oneechan~: I read the ending for mass effect 3, fuck them
[30-08-2014 14:48:41] Karuama-oneechan~: The demo for dragon age 2 was shit
[30-08-2014 14:48:54] Vegedus-dono~: Disregarding overly specific data points, btw.
[30-08-2014 14:48:58] Vegedus-dono~: More on average.
[30-08-2014 14:49:46] Karuama-oneechan~: On aaaaverage, if you don't warn the player that if they don't mine ore to improve their ship before killing a bunch of your party, that's shitty
[30-08-2014 14:49:58] Karuama-oneechan~: And ending a game with a giant terminator in space is shitty too
[30-08-2014 14:50:00] Vegedus-dono~: Lul
[30-08-2014 14:50:25] Vegedus-dono~: I guess it never occured to me NOT to upgrade the ship, so it's not an issue to me.
[30-08-2014 14:50:29] Vegedus-dono~: Upgrading is in my nature.
[30-08-2014 14:51:02] Karuama-oneechan~: Yeaaaah, they forced me to load, and go do a bunch of crappy second hand missions or lose my party
[30-08-2014 14:51:35] Vegedus-dono~: I think "lose your party" is supposed to be the chosen route in that case.
[30-08-2014 14:51:50] Karuama-oneechan~: I think "fuck you bioware"
[30-08-2014 14:52:08] Vegedus-dono~: The idea is consequences, the thing people always clamour about. Hard consequences if you don't do the stuff.
[30-08-2014 14:52:18] Vegedus-dono~: Perhaps badly implemented, though.
[30-08-2014 14:52:56] Karuama-oneechan~: Consequences as a concept does not mean, "don't upgrade this thing that does fuck all for you lose your party"
[30-08-2014 14:53:25 | Edited 14:53:37] Vegedus-dono~: I remember it as being foreshadowed that they had importance, but it could just be me reading walkthroughs
[30-08-2014 14:54:01] Karuama-oneechan~: Proooobably reading walkthroughs, but hey, "lady with a pig" didn't make me think "I was kidnapped"
[30-08-2014 14:54:23] Vegedus-dono~: SO U DUMB
[30-08-2014 14:54:27] Karuama-oneechan~: SO DUMB
[30-08-2014 14:55:03] Karuama-oneechan~: And yeah, cause and effect in narratives only makes sense if the cause and effect are understandably connected
[30-08-2014 14:55:24] Vegedus-dono~: I've heard some people really liked that your crew members could be killed off though. And I really liked the variation of the same concept in Banner Saga.
[30-08-2014 14:55:37] Karuama-oneechan~: So, "get the krogan his armor so when he throws his tantrum you don't have to brutally murder him" didn't work too well for me either
[30-08-2014 14:56:14] Karuama-oneechan~: The idea is neat, but the implementation, as you said, was not so great
[30-08-2014 14:56:23 | Edited 14:56:46] Vegedus-dono~: It's a grim world, so it's impossible to keep everyone with you; There will inevitably be traitors, deserters, and party members that die in cutscenes, but who and how many depends on your choices.
[30-08-2014 14:56:30] Vegedus-dono~: In the banner saga, that is.
[30-08-2014 14:56:39] Karuama-oneechan~: Well that sounds fabulous
[30-08-2014 14:56:55] Karuama-oneechan~: If you don't give your horse steroids, do they all die?
[30-08-2014 14:57:09] Vegedus-dono~: Uh, no horse party members
[30-08-2014 14:57:16] Karuama-oneechan~: Lame
[30-08-2014 14:57:35] Vegedus-dono~: It's by former Bioware employees, obviously disgruntled with their lack of influence and striking out on their own.
[30-08-2014 14:57:41] Karuama-oneechan~: OH
[30-08-2014 14:57:53] Karuama-oneechan~: Banner saga, awesomely animated 2d thing?
[30-08-2014 14:58:03] Vegedus-dono~: Highly recommend it! An above average tactical RPG battle systems too.
[30-08-2014 14:58:04] Vegedus-dono~: Yup
[30-08-2014 14:58:19] Karuama-oneechan~: Did Hamburger Hepler have anything to do with it?
[30-08-2014 14:58:26] Vegedus-dono~: Uh, dunno
[30-08-2014 14:59:13] Karuama-oneechan~: If lil' miss "the best thing you could do to include women as a market is include a skip button for the gameplay" had anything to do with it I don't believe you.
[30-08-2014 14:59:32] Vegedus-dono~: As I recall, it was only dudes. So probably not.
[30-08-2014 14:59:59] Karuama-oneechan~: Well then, I'll trust your judgement, and the fact that it looked rad.
[30-08-2014 15:03:17] Vegedus-dono~: (Mostly?) Unique thing about that game is that your narrative choices have real, heavy mechanical weight. You're deciding the fate of the people you carry into battle with you.
[30-08-2014 15:03:20] Vegedus-dono~: And it's hard as shit.
[30-08-2014 15:06:57] Karuama-oneechan~: Sounds better than the kind of neutered false choices most games have
[30-08-2014 15:08:14] Vegedus-dono~: I'd say Walking Dead have real choices. Not as far reaching as ideal, but as much as realistic. But they have no mechanical impact, because there's barely any mechanics in it.
[30-08-2014 15:08:36] Karuama-oneechan~: I've heard good things about walking dead
[30-08-2014 15:08:47] Karuama-oneechan~: But lately I've played very vew games
[30-08-2014 15:09:36] Karuama-oneechan~: I liked how the 'choices' at the end of hotline miami, lol
[30-08-2014 15:11:09] Vegedus-dono~: Hrm, there were hidden endings, but were there choices?
[30-08-2014 15:11:24 | Edited 15:11:27] Vegedus-dono~: Shit, no I youtubed it and the awesome music made me want to play it again.
[30-08-2014 15:11:36] Karuama-oneechan~: A choice of what to ask, and I think whether or not to kill
[30-08-2014 15:11:48] Karuama-oneechan~: All very meaningless, nothing really gained
[30-08-2014 15:12:26] Vegedus-dono~: Ah, yes. In a game of meaningless violence.
[30-08-2014 15:12:41] Karuama-oneechan~: Yup.
[30-08-2014 15:12:55] Vegedus-dono~: Have you seen the hidden ending?
[30-08-2014 15:13:04] Karuama-oneechan~: Not sure
[30-08-2014 15:13:08] Vegedus-dono~: That requires you collect hidden letters in each level
[30-08-2014 15:13:14] Karuama-oneechan~: Oh, lord no
[30-08-2014 15:13:18] Vegedus-dono~: Requires concerted effort
[30-08-2014 15:13:26] Karuama-oneechan~: That 50 blessing thing?
[30-08-2014 15:13:32] Wazit: oh yeah
[30-08-2014 15:13:33] Wazit: that shit
[30-08-2014 15:13:36] Wazit: done it
[30-08-2014 15:13:39] Karuama-oneechan~: Shit nah
[30-08-2014 15:13:48] Karuama-oneechan~: But I'd feel bad watching the end
[30-08-2014 15:13:53] Karuama-oneechan~: Also, hello Wazit
[30-08-2014 15:13:58] Wazit: hello there
[30-08-2014 15:13:59] Karuama-oneechan~: long time no see
[30-08-2014 15:14:08] Vegedus-dono~: HEY WE'RE CIRCLE JERKING HERE GET OUT
[30-08-2014 15:14:20] Wazit: TOO BAD
[30-08-2014 15:14:23] Karuama-oneechan~: LET'S GROW THE CIRCLE BRO
[30-08-2014 15:14:26] Wazit: IMMA MAKING IT A TRIANGLE
[30-08-2014 15:14:31] Karuama-oneechan~: AW YEA
[30-08-2014 15:14:38] Karuama-oneechan~: THIS IS SOME PARANORMAL ACTIVITY SHIT
[30-08-2014 15:14:49] Karuama-oneechan~: TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES
[30-08-2014 15:15:06] *** Vegedus-dono~ has changed the conversation topic to "Rapscallions: Don't leave a guy hanging. His dick. Hanging. That is." ***
[30-08-2014 15:15:13] Karuama-oneechan~: huehue
[30-08-2014 15:15:26] Wazit: SOME DARK SATANIC SHIT THIS IS
[30-08-2014 15:16:09] Vegedus-dono~: But yeah, the secret ending to Hotline Miami provides a lot of context and plot twists.
[30-08-2014 15:16:21] Karuama-oneechan~: Hrmph
[30-08-2014 15:16:25] Vegedus-dono~: To a degree it's almost a shame it uncovers some of the mysteries.
[30-08-2014 15:16:34 | Edited 15:16:36] Vegedus-dono~: The "it was all meaningless" ending is fine too.
[30-08-2014 15:16:49] Karuama-oneechan~: I'm happy with the meaninglessness. ;(
[30-08-2014 15:16:58] Vegedus-dono~: Well, good.
[30-08-2014 15:17:04] Vegedus-dono~: BECAUSE LIFE AND EVERYTHING IN IT IS
[30-08-2014 15:17:07] Wazit: yeah it was a surprise
[30-08-2014 15:17:12] Wazit: SHALL I SPOIL IT?
[30-08-2014 15:17:18] Karuama-oneechan~: NO
[30-08-2014 15:17:25] Wazit: HUE HUE HUE
[30-08-2014 15:17:43] Vegedus-dono~: It's not THAT hard to get the secret ending if you have the internet help you a lil'.
[30-08-2014 15:17:56] Vegedus-dono~: Not to mention I didn't mind playing a bit more at that point.
[30-08-2014 15:24:01] Karuama-oneechan~: Done.
[30-08-2014 15:24:02] Karuama-oneechan~: http://imgur.com/OzgdKrN
[30-08-2014 15:24:47] Vegedus-dono~: It's a spoooooky ghoooooost
[30-08-2014 15:25:17] Karuama-oneechan~: Spooopy wizard zombie ghost
[30-08-2014 15:31:29] Wazit: the hell is that?
[30-08-2014 15:34:11] Karuama-oneechan~: An enemy I made
[30-08-2014 15:34:24] Karuama-oneechan~: He will cast magics
[30-08-2014 15:34:34] Karuama-oneechan~: And with that, I bid you all a goodnight
[30-08-2014 15:35:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's 1:30 PM
[30-08-2014 15:36:39] Karuama-oneechan~: It's 6:30 am
[30-08-2014 15:36:58] Karuama-oneechan~: I was up all night working, deal w/i
[30-08-2014 15:38:51] Vegedus-dono~: And you wanted someone to entertain you whilst, clearly?
[30-08-2014 15:39:09] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Hmm... Fable Anniversary with 20% discount on GMG
[30-08-2014 15:39:13] Vegedus-dono~: Apparently you can multitask, while I just WASTED my morning talking to you.
[30-08-2014 15:39:19] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and they just gave me a voucher for an extra 23% discount...
[30-08-2014 15:39:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: HMMMMMMmmmm....
[30-08-2014 15:39:34] Vegedus-dono~: Eh. That's not even the very common 50 %.
[30-08-2014 15:39:46] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's quite a bit for a pre-purchase
[30-08-2014 15:39:49] Vegedus-dono~: And Fable isn't great enough that it can't wait for a better deal.
[30-08-2014 15:40:27] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: regular price is 31.99
[30-08-2014 15:40:37] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I can get it for 19.71
[30-08-2014 15:40:39] Karuama-oneechan~: Yes Veggie, thank you for letting me waste your morning
[30-08-2014 15:41:30] Vegedus-dono~: I COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING MINECRAFT. CLEARLY A BETTER USE OF MY TIME
[30-08-2014 15:42:13] Vegedus-dono~: I'd say Fable is a great candidate for "wait till 75% off"
[30-08-2014 15:42:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I checked on BL: Pre-Sequel
[30-08-2014 15:42:40] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: but even with the voucher it's a bit expensive for my tastes
[30-08-2014 15:44:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: the reward you get for prepurchasing ain't that good either
[30-08-2014 15:45:20] Vegedus-dono~: I'm sure you've heard about the problematic aspects of getting suckered in by prepurchasing too, right?
[30-08-2014 15:45:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: game of the year edition being released eventually?
[30-08-2014 15:46:08] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I would have worried about that with BL2 if it weren't for the fact that I have all the important dlcs and I didn't even buy half of them
[30-08-2014 15:46:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so I spent the same amount one would have spent on the GOTY edition
[30-08-2014 15:46:32] Vegedus-dono~: Nah, not quite that.
[30-08-2014 15:47:13] Vegedus-dono~: encouraging people to buy games before they have reviews out and the like. Sight unseen, basically
[30-08-2014 15:47:26 | Edited 15:47:29] Vegedus-dono~: And when trailers lie, as they did with Aliens: Colonial Marines...
[30-08-2014 15:47:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: true true
[30-08-2014 15:47:50] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I don't really pre-purchase that much
[30-08-2014 15:48:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: last game I did it with was actually BL2 and I regret nothing
[30-08-2014 15:48:18] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: but yeah, it's a dangerous business
[30-08-2014 15:48:38] Vegedus-dono~: Plus some other industry culture things. Think it was Total Biscuit that ranted thoroughly about it.
[30-08-2014 18:19:54] *** Stuff-chan~ has changed the conversation topic to "Rapscallions: Almost one month until the Spoop." ***

"*****ATTENTION ALL WHITE KNIGHTS AND SJWs*****

Yes, private pictures of all these celebrities were released to the public. And yes, it is those celebrities' faults. Countless numbers of phone hacks and leaked pictures have plagued the world of A-list actresses before this event. It should be common knowledge by now NOT to keep nude pictures of yourself on file. Any female celebrity that does this is a whore begging for attention, and they deserve exactly what has just happened.

Today has been a great victory for my dick."

[01-09-2014 01:26:27] Stuff-chan~: SOMEONE HACKED IT AND TOOK THEIR INFORMATION
[01-09-2014 01:27:06] Stuff-chan~: Yes. I have icloud. I can obviously go in and delete unwanted pictures.

Who cares? It's back up storage. You take your pictures and it saves. Go and delete what you don't want.
[01-09-2014 01:29:28] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: safety measures
[01-09-2014 01:29:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: guess it will happen NOW that they've been hacked
[01-09-2014 01:30:27] Stuff-chan~: Or this shouldn't be an issue because one asshole decided to invade countless women's privacy. Apple needs better security.

[01-09-2014 01:31:59] Vegedus-dono~: I don't think you can get good enough security
[01-09-2014 01:32:33] Vegedus-dono~: Hacking isn't one thing you can defend against. It's every single loophole that can be exploited. Defending against it is like defending against human fallability
[01-09-2014 01:32:39] Stuff-chan~: Obviously something needs to be done. And not saving your nudes, where you look damn good, shouldn't be the thing to change~
[01-09-2014 01:32:48] Tuor-onii-sama!~: true dat
[01-09-2014 01:33:03] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Not saving them ON a thing that sends it to a cloud
[01-09-2014 01:33:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: save all your nudes all you want, just try to keep it away from such things
[01-09-2014 01:33:32] Vegedus-dono~: I guess it could be that all these big-ass corporations just have poor security overall (sony was held liable, at least), but I doubt it.

[01-09-2014 01:34:09] Tuor-onii-sama!~: this is straying dangerously close to "they were asking for it" wording
[01-09-2014 01:34:17] Stuff-chan~: Yes, yes it is.
[01-09-2014 01:34:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: clearly the same thing, woman
[01-09-2014 01:34:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: clearly
[01-09-2014 01:34:45] Vegedus-dono~: Just for the record, I'm not arguing that. I'm solely talking about how security is inherently flimsy.
[01-09-2014 01:34:47] Stuff-chan~: It's basically what you're saying. Avoid your nudes with this, so you don't get hacked.
[01-09-2014 01:35:02] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: take nude, send it to whoever you want to
[01-09-2014 01:35:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: keep it on a folder on the pc that isn't linked to a cloud
[01-09-2014 01:35:24] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: safety measures
[01-09-2014 01:35:28] Stuff-chan~: That's way too much fucking work for something that shouldn't be an issue
[01-09-2014 01:35:31] Vegedus-dono~: Thing is, I think a lot people have potentially embarrasing stuff in their dropbox or whatever.
[01-09-2014 01:35:38] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's a nude
[01-09-2014 01:35:39] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Carry mace
[01-09-2014 01:35:40] Vegedus-dono~: It's not really fair to blame them if it gets out.
[01-09-2014 01:35:47] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you cannot take that lightly
[01-09-2014 01:35:49] Stuff-chan~: Your point?
[01-09-2014 01:35:51] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: ESPECIALLY with celebs
[01-09-2014 01:35:53] Stuff-chan~: No one take nudes!
[01-09-2014 01:35:59] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you know people want those
[01-09-2014 01:36:05] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: and we're seeing that happening right fucking now
[01-09-2014 01:36:06] Stuff-chan~: ITS YOUR FAULT IF THEY'RE LEAKED CAUSE YOU WEREN'T SAFE ENOUGH
[01-09-2014 01:36:27] Stuff-chan~: AVOID ALCOHOL, TOO, TO BE SAFE, SO YOU'RE NOT DRUGGED
[01-09-2014 01:36:43] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: going on a loop here and I guess there's nothing else to it

I don't keep important things on dropbox's cloud.
[01-09-2014 01:38:13] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: cause you never know what might happen

[01-09-2014 01:41:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I'm not trying to blame celebs. There are crazy fans that will do ANYTHING to get nudes and such, they're horrible people for it. And we've seen cases of this happening before
[01-09-2014 01:41:34 | Edited 01:42:04] Vegedus-dono~: On general principle I would say taking precautions when there's known risks is a good thing. But that doesn't mean someone elses malicious actions are your fault because you didn't take those precautions. It doesn't mean we shouldn't get at the root of the problems rather than shrug and go "wear a thicker coat".
[01-09-2014 01:41:58] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: I dunno, I just thought they would learn from the poor accidents that happened to others. To keep the nudes that are meant to be private things safe.
[01-09-2014 01:42:25] Vegedus-dono~: Sure. But we still shouldn't be pointing the finger at the celebs.
[01-09-2014 01:42:29] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: a thing that keeps 'em on a cloud is not safe and I realise it's not really their fault that that's how Apple works
[01-09-2014 01:43:52] Vegedus-dono~: Life is inherently risky. Every bit of laziness or carelessness can come back to bite you in the ass. It's promoting a very anxious lifestyle to blame people for not taking every precaution for everything.
[01-09-2014 01:44:17] Wazit: See we don't have problems like this before the advent of internet :O
[01-09-2014 01:44:19] Stuff-chan~: Hiryu, I don't think you're fully aware that you're unintentionally blaming them. Both you and Veg are basically arguing the same thing, but you keep going back to "they should know better" "they should be safer"
[01-09-2014 01:44:32] Vegedus-dono~: Heard of tabloids?
[01-09-2014 01:44:46] Wazit: yeah but not widespread ones like these
[01-09-2014 01:45:01] Wazit: a whole bunch in one swoop
[01-09-2014 01:45:01] Vegedus-dono~: I don't think the scale of it really matters for the victims.
[01-09-2014 01:45:09] Stuff-chan~: There are cases with, for instance
[01-09-2014 01:45:12] Vegedus-dono~: Though there are more victims, true.
[01-09-2014 01:45:14] Tuor-onii-sama!~: *tagging out to go shower*
[01-09-2014 01:45:15] Stuff-chan~: Hayley Williams from Paramore

[01-09-2014 01:45:20] Wazit: oops ninja'd
[01-09-2014 01:45:23] Stuff-chan~: Accidentally uploaded a nude to twitter
[01-09-2014 01:45:57] Vegedus-dono~: Uuuh, right now?
[01-09-2014 01:46:01] Stuff-chan~: That can be blamed on her, because she should have been more careful with that. But is it her fault a bunch of people shared and distributed it everywhere? No.
[01-09-2014 01:46:27] Stuff-chan~: This, though? None of it is their fault.
[01-09-2014 01:46:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: oh, was thinking another nude of her had been leaked.
[01-09-2014 01:46:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: It's Apple's?

[01-09-2014 03:37:41] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: long tails up in the air and whatnot
[01-09-2014 03:37:42] Stuff-chan~: Idk if that's a high five

[01-09-2014 03:38:10] Stuff-chan~: Ahh
[01-09-2014 03:38:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you'll notice in photos they have their tails cut
[01-09-2014 03:38:36] Tuor-onii-sama!~: mhmm
[01-09-2014 03:38:37] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: First thing he did when he was left outta the cage was piss right in the living room
[01-09-2014 03:38:42] Stuff-chan~: Yah. Like how they do doberman
[01-09-2014 03:38:49] Stuff-chan~: Typical doggy
[01-09-2014 03:38:53] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: or Boxers

[01-09-2014 03:39:31] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: But yeah, I'm happy Chucky isn't so bummed out anymore
[01-09-2014 03:39:35] Tuor-onii-sama!~: :D
[01-09-2014 03:39:50] Stuff-chan~: Good!
[01-09-2014 03:40:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: we still have to be careful with them 'cause he doesn't realise how strong he is and might end up hurting Toby on accident
[01-09-2014 03:40:23] Tuor-onii-sama!~: true

[01-09-2014 03:42:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Chucky was used to being rough with Rudy
[01-09-2014 03:42:12] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so it's understandable that he might hurt Toby
[01-09-2014 03:43:44] Stuff-chan~: Yah
[01-09-2014 03:43:57] Stuff-chan~: Meanwhile Brindi is used to bigger dogs
[01-09-2014 03:44:06] Stuff-chan~: Cause she was rough with Lucky
[01-09-2014 03:44:13] Stuff-chan~: And now there's Bear
[01-09-2014 03:44:21] Stuff-chan~: But Bear is bigger, and doesn't realise it
[01-09-2014 03:45:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: so...

[01-09-2014 20:59:55] Calek Albion: started up Super Mario 3D Land again after months and months of not playing it, nice to come back to a file that has 100% completion up to the point where I left off
[01-09-2014 21:00:33] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Welp
[01-09-2014 21:00:45] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Time to make another new file?
[01-09-2014 21:00:54] Calek Albion: why would I do that
[01-09-2014 21:01:29] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Wait, how many saved files can you have?
[01-09-2014 21:01:35] Calek Albion: 3
[01-09-2014 21:02:00] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Why not make another? I'd be fun to go back and beat the levels again.
[01-09-2014 21:02:25] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Then again, never played the game so i wouldn't know how hard it is to get 100% again.
[01-09-2014 21:02:46] Calek Albion: it's not that hard, I just don't want to do it again, already half way through the game
[01-09-2014 21:03:40] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Oh, well keep on trucking then with what you're doin' then
[01-09-2014 21:03:47] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Is the game good?
[01-09-2014 21:04:40] Calek Albion: sure it's pretty good, a little on the simple side but good
[01-09-2014 21:07:35] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yeah, I've heard that some of the new Mario games are simple
[01-09-2014 21:07:52] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: With the exception of the Galaxy games
[01-09-2014 21:08:18] Calek Albion: they're fun though
[01-09-2014 21:08:27] Calek Albion: I wish Nintendo would make another Mario 64 type game though
[01-09-2014 21:08:57] Warby-kun~: isn't that what Galaxy is supposed to be?
[01-09-2014 21:08:59] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: True, that is what they're developed for: to be fun.
[01-09-2014 21:09:26] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Man, I need to get a 3DS or Wii U sooner or later
[01-09-2014 21:09:55] Calek Albion: Galaxy was good but it lacked the cool hub worlds of 64 and Sunshine
[01-09-2014 21:10:35] Calek Albion: and then Galaxy 2 didn't even try
[01-09-2014 21:11:04] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Have those two, still haven't played/finished 'em

[01-09-2014 21:12:36 | Edited 21:12:58] Calek Albion: also Galaxy didn't have the open world exploration of the worlds, each level was pretty linear which would allow for great level design but it's just a preference on my part
[01-09-2014 21:13:17] Male The  Grape Ape: But World has you as a cat
[01-09-2014 21:13:29] Male The  Grape Ape: Exploring a japan themed world
[01-09-2014 21:13:42] Male The  Grape Ape: Fighting giant snake dino things
[01-09-2014 21:14:06] Calek Albion: that is pretty cool
[01-09-2014 21:14:14] Male The  Grape Ape: That's some of the weirdness I enjoy in a mario game

[02-09-2014 04:47:42] Warby-kun~: which they do
[02-09-2014 04:47:58] Warby-kun~: and it's a thing in the Xkit mobile app that you can search multiple tags
[02-09-2014 04:48:08] Tuor-onii-sama!~: you can also whitelist things
[02-09-2014 04:48:35] calek01: what's the multiple tags thing called
[02-09-2014 04:48:37] Warby-kun~: yyyyyeah but I think that's a thing that kinda gets around blacklists, isn't it?
[02-09-2014 04:49:35] Warby-kun~: like, if you blacklist nsfw so you don't see images, but white list 'nsfw text' you'd be shown the text.
[02-09-2014 04:50:02] Tuor-onii-sama!~: From what i remember whitelist makes every post tagged as that show up

[03-09-2014 08:29:55] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Welp, that explains it

[03-09-2014 08:40:36] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Baffling how?
[03-09-2014 08:41:09] thefighterofthenightman: baffling like "What the hell are you doing" "can you not hear your partner screaming" "what was your plan?" "why are you doing that"
[03-09-2014 08:42:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Ah, that kind.

[04-09-2014 03:00:02] Warby-kun~: mhmmmmmm
[04-09-2014 03:00:08] Warby-kun~: because that's the same
[04-09-2014 03:00:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: you're pissed that a lame character in a lame show has no last name
[04-09-2014 03:00:45] calek01: Penny's last name is not even referenced, it's never been a joke on the show
[04-09-2014 03:01:02] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's been asked what her last name is
[04-09-2014 03:01:15] calek01: actually why am I even trying to defend this, I should care less
[04-09-2014 03:01:20] Warby-kun~: by people IN the show?
[04-09-2014 03:01:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: lol
[04-09-2014 03:01:26] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: yes
[04-09-2014 03:01:36] Warby-kun~: that makes it worse
[04-09-2014 03:01:39] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: think the latest case was someone asking Howard

And a woman, which they already are super problematic with women on it in general! 8D
[04-09-2014 03:01:45] Warby-kun~: BECAUSE it's used as a cheap laugh
[04-09-2014 03:02:04] Warby-kun~: not to mention
[04-09-2014 03:02:05] Warby-kun~: race
[04-09-2014 03:02:08] Warby-kun~: religion
[04-09-2014 03:02:14] Warby-kun~: the disabled
[04-09-2014 03:02:16] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: yes, that one I already pointed out
[04-09-2014 03:02:18 | Edited 03:02:25] Warby-kun~: nerd culture
[04-09-2014 03:02:36] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: please continue this list of things we already know are wrong with the show
[04-09-2014 03:02:40] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: go right ahead
[04-09-2014 03:02:45] Warby-kun~: uwu
[04-09-2014 03:03:01] Warby-kun~: I just can't see how anyone can possibly enjoy it
[04-09-2014 03:03:11] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: wanna make it worse?
[04-09-2014 03:03:14] Warby-kun~: because it's far too heavily geared towards lowest common denominator
[04-09-2014 03:03:19] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: the actors demanded way better pays to continue the show
[04-09-2014 03:03:40] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: it's the Jersey Shore of sitcoms?
[04-09-2014 03:03:42 | Edited 03:03:54] calek01: the guy who plays sheldon wouldn't continue the show until some of the other actors got a huge raise as well
[04-09-2014 03:04:08] Warby-kun~: all the actors in the show could do way better things
[04-09-2014 03:04:17] Stuff-chan~: Robert Downey Jr already did that
[04-09-2014 03:04:49] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: ...
Crap, think the only sitcom that is currently running that I've seen and enjoy is Modern Family
[04-09-2014 03:04:58] Warby-kun~: hmmmmm
[04-09-2014 03:05:05] Warby-kun~: yeah
[04-09-2014 03:05:10] calek01: I just blanked on all the sitcoms I watch now
[04-09-2014 03:05:26] calek01: Modern Family not among them
[04-09-2014 03:05:36] Stuff-chan~: Parks and Rec, yo
[04-09-2014 03:05:39] Warby-kun~: with all the sitcoms there are on TV, I'm still gonna watch Seinfeld and Friends.
[04-09-2014 03:05:47] calek01: [4. september 2014 03:04] Stuff-chan~: 

<<< Parks and Rec, yobest one ever
[04-09-2014 03:06:18] Warby-kun~: I never really thought of that or The Office as sitcoms, but I guess they are
[04-09-2014 03:06:40] Stuff-chan~: Always Sunny is also pretty fabulous.
[04-09-2014 03:06:45] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Oh, right
[04-09-2014 03:06:46] calek01: single camera sitcoms are the way to go these days
[04-09-2014 03:06:50] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: forgot about Always Sunny
[04-09-2014 03:07:24] Stuff-chan~: But where they are racist or whatever ignorant thing they're doing, the characters aren't necessarily supposed to be liked. They're showing problematic things on purpose.
[04-09-2014 03:09:55] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Shots fired

[04-09-2014 03:10:04] Warby-kun~: I've heard it compared to Seinfeld after it's last episode
[04-09-2014 03:10:12] Warby-kun~: but it gets worse
[04-09-2014 03:11:11 | Edited 03:11:22] Stuff-chan~: It's actually pretty similar to Seinfeld in the humor wise division
[04-09-2014 03:11:30] Stuff-chan~: But yeah. It's an interesting show lol
[04-09-2014 03:11:39] Warby-kun~: apparently it's gonna be or is on Canadian Netflix

[04-09-2014 08:41:01] Warby-kun~: I think the latter is the most common, actually

[04-09-2014 09:03:13] thefighterofthenightman: yes I know
[04-09-2014 09:04:03] thefighterofthenightman: I have strange friends

[04-09-2014 09:04:49] thefighterofthenightman: then again this shit's hilarious
[04-09-2014 09:06:29] Riz-chaaan~: Bad acting is fun to mock
[04-09-2014 09:06:45] thefighterofthenightman: there's even a murder mystery plot to it
[04-09-2014 09:07:05] Riz-chaaan~: wtf
[04-09-2014 09:07:27] Riz-chaaan~: Yeah murder is such a boner factory
[04-09-2014 09:07:57] thefighterofthenightman: "without further ado, let's suck some d*ck" -delivered straight by a guy doing a toast
[04-09-2014 09:08:23] Riz-chaaan~: I should make a toast like that

[04-09-2014 09:10:30] Riz-chaaan~: I don't even watch porn with plot, I don't watch this shit for the story get to the fucking
[04-09-2014 09:11:24 | Edited 09:11:31] thefighterofthenightman: the sex scenes in these are censored by pandas lol
[04-09-2014 09:11:34] Riz-chaaan~: Oh excellent
[04-09-2014 09:12:28] Riz-chaaan~: I hope the noise is censored too
[04-09-2014 09:12:44] thefighterofthenightman: it's censored and edited
[04-09-2014 09:13:13] thefighterofthenightman: let me just say, from what I've seen...it's not even convincing
[04-09-2014 09:13:43] Riz-chaaan~: They try their hardest
[04-09-2014 09:14:00] thefighterofthenightman: OH MY GOD
[04-09-2014 09:14:12] thefighterofthenightman: hold on let me take a moment to process what this guy said
[04-09-2014 09:21:20] thefighterofthenightman: I don't know if you've seen commando but there's an actor in these...things that looks just like this one character from that film
[04-09-2014 09:21:32] thefighterofthenightman: it makes this all the more hilarious
[04-09-2014 09:22:10] Riz-chaaan~: But what did he say!!?!
[04-09-2014 09:22:28] thefighterofthenightman: oooh boy

[04-09-2014 09:27:49] Riz-chaaan~: -taps foot loudly-
[04-09-2014 09:30:03] thefighterofthenightman: -cue guy siting on a chair speaking in a monotone voice-  "Hi welcome to the special collectors edition to Score, I hope you enjoyed watching as I enjoyed making it." -close up of the guy's face-  "I'm sure you enjoyed watching one of my favorite scenes where -insert name- plowed my butt into the mattress"
[04-09-2014 09:31:25] thefighterofthenightman: he just says it so emotionless while trying to sound seductive
[04-09-2014 09:31:40] thefighterofthenightman: it's like a robot
[04-09-2014 09:32:47] thefighterofthenightman: there's more but, I REALLY shouldn't say it here
[04-09-2014 09:35:33] Riz-chaaan~: Ahahahahhaahahahaha
[04-09-2014 09:37:06] Riz-chaaan~: Yes I enjoyed it greatly sir
[04-09-2014 09:39:00] thefighterofthenightman: there's one that's called The Hills Have Bi's
[04-09-2014 09:39:17] Riz-chaaan~: Amazing
[04-09-2014 09:40:05] thefighterofthenightman: "Night of the living Bi-dolls"
[04-09-2014 09:50:15] thefighterofthenightman: well I had enough of that lol

[04-09-2014 09:53:41] Riz-chaaan~: Oh god
[04-09-2014 09:54:07] thefighterofthenightman: he looks like bennet from commando
[04-09-2014 09:55:18] thefighterofthenightman: actually none of these can top the bizarreness that is ben and Arthur
[04-09-2014 09:56:32] thefighterofthenightman: like take the room but have it with two dudes
[04-09-2014 09:58:44] Riz-chaaan~: I've never seen the room
[04-09-2014 09:59:08] thefighterofthenightman: oh that's another special experience
[04-09-2014 09:59:59] Riz-chaaan~: I suppose I should watch it some time
[04-09-2014 10:01:21] thefighterofthenightman: the room? totally
[04-09-2014 10:03:12] Riz-chaaan~: Seems to be a rite of passage in this society now
[04-09-2014 10:04:02] thefighterofthenightman: whenever I watch it, I play a game with my friends called "guess what nationality the director/star actor is"
[04-09-2014 10:07:21] Riz-chaaan~: The man is a mystery
[04-09-2014 10:07:42] Riz-chaaan~: Wiki isn't even sure how old he is
[04-09-2014 10:07:44] thefighterofthenightman: he sure is
[04-09-2014 10:07:48] thefighterofthenightman: lol
[04-09-2014 10:08:05] thefighterofthenightman: you get to see his bare ass in the film so there's that
[04-09-2014 10:08:25] Riz-chaaan~: You know I prefer the other side
[04-09-2014 10:09:11] thefighterofthenightman: oh god that must've been so awkward
[04-09-2014 10:09:20] thefighterofthenightman: sitting in bed pretending to have sex with tommy wiseau
[04-09-2014 10:14:54] Riz-chaaan~: It would have been more awkward to actually be doing it
[04-09-2014 10:15:27] thefighterofthenightman: OH GOD
[04-09-2014 10:15:55] thefighterofthenightman: "Anyway how is your sex life" -tommy wiseau
[04-09-2014 10:20:36] Riz-chaaan~: You're welcome
[04-09-2014 10:22:00] Riz-chaaan~: His last name is almost the French word for bird. Little TW trivia for ya.
[04-09-2014 10:22:19] thefighterofthenightman: aha!
[04-09-2014 10:22:25] thefighterofthenightman: so he's French...kinda...maybe
[04-09-2014 10:22:46] Riz-chaaan~: If that's his real last name, the eau suggests it yes
[04-09-2014 10:23:43] Riz-chaaan~: But that's probably a completely fake name and that's why no one can figure anything out about him
[04-09-2014 10:24:58] thefighterofthenightman: I google him and it claims that he's 58
[04-09-2014 10:25:23] thefighterofthenightman: and that he has another film that he's been working on since 2010
[04-09-2014 10:25:35] Riz-chaaan~: Its gonna be so good
[04-09-2014 10:25:46] thefighterofthenightman: you know, when it comes out
[04-09-2014 10:27:30] thefighterofthenightman: oh crap it's 4:30, I have to be up in two hours
[04-09-2014 10:27:47] Riz-chaaan~: Good job
[04-09-2014 10:28:16] thefighterofthenightman: if only I didn't get talked into watching bad porno!
[04-09-2014 10:28:56] Riz-chaaan~: You are not the first person to say that I'm sure
[04-09-2014 10:30:29] thefighterofthenightman: gonna listen to music to help me fall asleep
[04-09-2014 10:30:32] thefighterofthenightman: and i'm off!
[04-09-2014 10:30:41] Riz-chaaan~: Mkay gnight

[04-09-2014 18:30:42] Stuff-chan~: I've seen like 4. This is the second one I've killed in my room in about a week. And I killed a baby one in the bathroom right before that.

[04-09-2014 19:30:05] Calek Albion: there's one on my sink who's attached his web to my soap bottle and I'm just like "What are you doing, who do you think you are"
[04-09-2014 19:30:50] Stuff-chan~: *drowns it*

I APOLOGIZE AND ACTUALLY FEEL BAD. Not being a piece of shit and trying to make it "okay". Also the shit with him trying to defend video games with the brutalization and objectified of women, and being a piece of shit about it.

I miss when Bear's ears were floppy..[5. september 2014 03:26] Tuor-onii-sama!~: 

<<< I believe when i looked at pics of the breed
they stay like thatDing ding ding
[05-09-2014 03:39:43] Tuor-onii-sama!~: (party)
[05-09-2014 03:39:47] Stuff-chan~: it's funny to me
[05-09-2014 03:39:51] Stuff-chan~: that most hunting dogs
[05-09-2014 03:39:54] Stuff-chan~: have flopping ears
[05-09-2014 03:40:01] Stuff-chan~: but then like.. wolves and akitas
[05-09-2014 03:40:06 | Edited 03:40:11] Stuff-chan~: have the ears that go up
[05-09-2014 03:40:29] Tuor-onii-sama!~: Ya, it's interesting
[05-09-2014 03:40:38] Stuff-chan~: dogs are weirdddd
[05-09-2014 03:40:40] Stuff-chan~: but I wub them
[05-09-2014 03:40:45] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I guess it t's useful to prevent like, twigs and shit getting int heir ears
[05-09-2014 03:41:30] Tuor-onii-sama!~: when they're retrieving dead things/chasing animals out of the underbrush
[05-09-2014 03:41:55] Stuff-chan~: still doesn't make sense for wolves though
[05-09-2014 03:42:16] Stuff-chan~: I know ears that stick up help with hearing
[05-09-2014 03:42:23] Stuff-chan~: so I guess hunting dogs rely more on smell??
[05-09-2014 03:42:49] Tuor-onii-sama!~: I *think* so?
[05-09-2014 03:42:55] Stuff-chan~: cause fucking Bear can hear shit a mile away
[05-09-2014 03:42:57] Stuff-chan~: he's fucking nuts
[05-09-2014 03:43:07] Stuff-chan~: he gets in that stance
[05-09-2014 03:43:18] Stuff-chan~: then like 5 minutes later we see the car he heard going by
[05-09-2014 03:43:29] Stuff-chan~: Hiryuuuu
[05-09-2014 03:43:38] Stuff-chan~: do hunting dogs rely more on smell, than hearing?
[05-09-2014 03:45:14] Stuff-chan~: I would assume that's the issue
[05-09-2014 03:45:40] Stuff-chan~: even though wolves also hunt, they're more prone to listening than smelling
[05-09-2014 03:45:50] Stuff-chan~: I would assume
[05-09-2014 03:45:56] Stuff-chan~: hence the howling for communication
[05-09-2014 03:46:07] Stuff-chan~: and packs and stuff
[05-09-2014 03:46:12] Stuff-chan~: good god I'm rambling
[05-09-2014 03:47:11] Tuor-onii-sama!~: hahaha, I'm researching
[05-09-2014 03:48:34] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I... think hunting dogs rely on smell based on my knowledge of movies

[05-09-2014 23:28:49] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: SPAAAAAAAAACE
[05-09-2014 23:28:59] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Well, I'm havin' difficulty with my C++ hw
[05-09-2014 23:29:04] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: It's... bleh
[05-09-2014 23:29:18] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: And a lot of people in my class already finished it IN CLASS
[05-09-2014 23:29:33] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: -.- weh
[05-09-2014 23:30:45] Warby-kun~: \o/
[05-09-2014 23:30:53] Warby-kun~: I only work four hours today
[05-09-2014 23:31:01] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Wooooh
[05-09-2014 23:31:11] Warby-kun~: gonna beat Dark Souls again
[05-09-2014 23:32:15] Warby-kun~: (party)
[05-09-2014 23:32:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Key word: Again
[05-09-2014 23:33:21] Warby-kun~: third time now.
[05-09-2014 23:33:38] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Wow
[05-09-2014 23:33:48] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I wanna know how many times you died...
[05-09-2014 23:34:09] Warby-kun~: not a lot after the first time, really
[05-09-2014 23:34:27] Warby-kun~: at least, not nearly as much
[05-09-2014 23:35:04] Warby-kun~: I've even managed to kill some of the harder bosses on one go
[05-09-2014 23:35:08] Warby-kun~: Warby-kun~ shrugs
[05-09-2014 23:35:25] Warby-kun~: it's really not as hard as people say once you learn the mechanics and enemy patterns.
[05-09-2014 23:36:49] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Welp
[05-09-2014 23:36:53] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Now I wanna play it
[05-09-2014 23:37:35] Warby-kun~: do it
[05-09-2014 23:37:37] Warby-kun~: you'll love it
[05-09-2014 23:37:42] Warby-kun~: and then hate it
[05-09-2014 23:37:46] Warby-kun~: and then love it
[05-09-2014 23:37:51] Warby-kun~: ad infinitum
[05-09-2014 23:39:20] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: "I love the parts of the game where I hate it"
[05-09-2014 23:40:58 | Edited 23:41:20] Warby-kun~: that's the great thing. you'll spend hours getting your ass handed to you and then, against all odds, you kill this thing that's three to ten to twenty times your size. sometimes even two at once.
[05-09-2014 23:41:05] Warby-kun~: and it feels so satisfying.
[05-09-2014 23:48:51] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Oooo those feelings are nice
[05-09-2014 23:49:00] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Wonder how many trophies/achievements there are
[05-09-2014 23:49:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Did the game take you long to beat?
[05-09-2014 23:52:48] Warby-kun~: hmm
[05-09-2014 23:52:57] Warby-kun~: it wouldn't have if I played it straight through
[05-09-2014 23:53:16] Warby-kun~: but there was a couple month period where I was just pissed off at it
[05-09-2014 23:53:45] Warby-kun~: and it took me watching through Gurren Lagann while playing it to power through it
[05-09-2014 23:54:35] Warby-kun~: most of the achievements are for entering specific covenants and upgrading your weapons to max in different ways
[05-09-2014 23:54:50] Warby-kun~: and there's one for each of the two endings
[05-09-2014 23:55:42] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Hmmm, interesting
[05-09-2014 23:55:52] Warby-kun~: and then others scattered throughout
[05-09-2014 23:56:59] Warby-kun~: but yeah, play it
[05-09-2014 23:57:10] Warby-kun~: like, especially if you like Castlevania
[05-09-2014 23:57:25] Warby-kun~: because in DS2 you can go through with a Belmont RP build
[05-09-2014 23:58:38] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Hrm, never played Castlevania but always wanted to
[05-09-2014 23:58:43] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: The first one, to be precise
[05-09-2014 23:58:56] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Bleh, so many games I wanna play...
[05-09-2014 23:59:20] Warby-kun~: oh come on, Eggs
[05-09-2014 23:59:40] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: -3- I knooowwww...
[05-09-2014 23:59:57] Warby-kun~: I'd almost say that Dark Souls is like a good Castlevania 2
[06-09-2014 00:00:09] Warby-kun~: except in 3D
[06-09-2014 00:00:38] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: And longer
[06-09-2014 00:00:58] Warby-kun~: it's not that long
[06-09-2014 00:01:02] Warby-kun~: it's just a war of attrition
[06-09-2014 00:01:20] Warby-kun~: you COULD go through it in a day
[06-09-2014 00:01:22] Warby-kun~: if you wanted
[06-09-2014 00:01:44] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: 24 hours? Woof, that'll be there day
[06-09-2014 00:01:49] Warby-kun~: if you do end up playing it, just come to me for tips ;)
[06-09-2014 00:02:20] Warby-kun~: okay, a day is too literal. one sitting.
[06-09-2014 00:03:02] Warby-kun~: I did that on my Gurren run
[06-09-2014 00:13:29] Calek Albion: Demon's Souls is best Souls =3
[06-09-2014 00:14:55] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Souls o3o
[06-09-2014 00:23:34] Karuama-oneechan~: Calek knows about them souls, fuck all y'all dark souls nerds
[06-09-2014 00:26:37] Warby-kun~: fuck Demon's Souls
[06-09-2014 00:26:49 | Edited 00:26:57] Warby-kun~: far more complex than it needs to be with world tendencies
[06-09-2014 00:27:39] Warby-kun~: I'd rather play a game where I can see everything without relying on the entire damned community
[06-09-2014 00:28:17] Karuama-oneechan~: Well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
[06-09-2014 00:28:20] Warby-kun~: the entire now non-existent community
[06-09-2014 00:29:54] Warby-kun~: that being said, I will continue playing it after I get a PS3 for P5.
[06-09-2014 00:30:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Pee Faive
[06-09-2014 00:30:35] Calek Albion: World Tendency is a lot less complicated than you think
[06-09-2014 00:30:57] Calek Albion: you want pure white? Then don't die in human form and just kill bosses, you want pure black? keep dying in body form ezpz
[06-09-2014 00:31:26] Calek Albion: and there's only events at either pure black or pure white
[06-09-2014 00:31:47] Warby-kun~: but they still rely on the community
[06-09-2014 00:33:19] Calek Albion: oh well?
[06-09-2014 00:33:37] Calek Albion: or you can figure out what the events are yourself
[06-09-2014 00:35:10] Calek Albion: world tendency doesn't really even matter unless you're going for 100%
[06-09-2014 00:35:32] Warby-kun~: but there's eveeeeeents
[06-09-2014 00:35:47] Warby-kun~: all events in Dark Souls can just be TRIGGERED
[06-09-2014 00:35:52] Warby-kun~: without excessive grinding
[06-09-2014 00:36:20] Warby-kun~: and I'm not saying Demon's is a bad game by any means
[06-09-2014 00:36:31] Warby-kun~: I just hate that level of contrivance
[06-09-2014 00:36:43] Calek Albion: actually I shouldn't even defend world tendency, I'm actually glad they got rid of it
[06-09-2014 00:40:02] Warby-kun~: so am i
[06-09-2014 00:40:09] Warby-kun~: THAT BEING SAID
[06-09-2014 00:40:16] Warby-kun~: it's still a 10/10 game
[06-09-2014 00:40:28] Warby-kun~: that I will play thoroughly and discover completely
[06-09-2014 00:40:42] Calek Albion: I'm doing that this weekend, making a big push for platinum trophy
[06-09-2014 00:40:58] Calek Albion: am I cheating? absolutely because the grinding in this game is ridiculous
[06-09-2014 00:41:00] Warby-kun~: I just have the rather large hurdle of buying a PS3
[06-09-2014 00:41:11] Warby-kun~: god damn exclusives
[06-09-2014 00:41:12] Calek Albion: 8 hours to get one upgrade material chunk give me a break
[06-09-2014 00:41:27] Warby-kun~: you know what's great about Dark?
[06-09-2014 00:41:30] Warby-kun~: Frampt.
[06-09-2014 00:41:41] Warby-kun~: or however you spell it
[06-09-2014 00:41:59] Warby-kun~: feed him a chunk and get a handful of large shards
[06-09-2014 00:42:01] Warby-kun~: fantastic
[06-09-2014 00:43:13] Calek Albion: haven't done much lately with my latest DS1 character, I died to the second asylum demon and I got salty
[06-09-2014 00:45:17] Warby-kun~: I beat him today in one go. uwu
[06-09-2014 00:45:37] Warby-kun~: just stick behind him and back off when he does that wimpy overhead.
[06-09-2014 00:45:59] Calek Albion: he got himself stuck in a corner and did his biggest AOE attack and I couldn't recover, it was garbage
[06-09-2014 00:46:36] Calek Albion: got the Demon Machete super early and just two handing that, tons of fun
[06-09-2014 00:46:40] Calek Albion: jump attack all day err day
[06-09-2014 00:49:29] Warby-kun~: you should get the Gravelord Sword
[06-09-2014 00:59:08] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
[06-09-2014 00:59:12] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I'll give Dark Souls a try
[06-09-2014 00:59:31] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: (sorry kara and Calek (not really))

[06-09-2014 02:15:21] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: cause it happens?
[06-09-2014 02:15:41] Warby-kun~: nah, they fuck up while bug fixing because they ignore QA.
[06-09-2014 02:17:07] Warby-kun~: and they then use them as a scapegoat when people get pissed about bugs
[06-09-2014 02:17:09] Warby-kun~: it's great
[06-09-2014 02:17:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: unlike Bethesda
[06-09-2014 02:17:29] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: they man up and make it seem like they are features
[06-09-2014 02:17:48] Warby-kun~: nah, the FANS blame QA in Bethesda games
[06-09-2014 02:18:07] Warby-kun~: but like

[06-09-2014 03:03:29] Tuor-onii-sama!~: some of the early popular ones etc
[06-09-2014 03:05:54] Warby-kun~: QA is not Questions and Answers
[06-09-2014 03:06:00] Warby-kun~: it's Quality Assurance
[06-09-2014 03:06:12] Warby-kun~: Q&A is Questions and Answers
[06-09-2014 03:07:38] Tuor-onii-sama!~: ooooh
[06-09-2014 03:07:41] Tuor-onii-sama!~: ok
[06-09-2014 03:20:11] Vegedus-dono~: And so it happened, on that fateful, friday night, that a certain character of a name starting with 'V', returned from an evening of gratis alcohol.
[06-09-2014 03:20:40 | Edited 03:20:47] Vegedus-dono~: And that same character wondered aloud, whether anyone would be interested in a call made up of ramblings most drunken.
[06-09-2014 03:21:20] Calek Albion: not even a little bit
[06-09-2014 03:22:16] Hiroko-imouto~: Watching Swimming Anime.
[06-09-2014 03:22:23] Vegedus-dono~: 'Tis a shame, for this character with the first letter of the name of 'V' made a reputation out of primarily such drunken ramblings.
[06-09-2014 03:24:03] Vegedus-dono~: [6. september 2014 03:22] Hiroko-imouto~: 

<<< Watching Swimming Anime.Yarr free?
[06-09-2014 03:24:14] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: Yeah, she free
[06-09-2014 03:24:43] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Are we talking about V from 'V for Vendetta'?
[06-09-2014 03:25:55] Vegedus-dono~: And on despite that friday night being ever so fateful, the one known as Exodis acted ever so in-character, fully ignoring the name of the poster in question.
[06-09-2014 03:26:49] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Remember remember, the 5th of November
[06-09-2014 03:27:40] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Also, "acted ever so in-character"? >[
[06-09-2014 03:27:49] Vegedus-dono~: Remember remember, eggs is clueless and has oatmeal for brains.
[06-09-2014 03:28:19] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Oh fuck off 'V for Vagina'
[06-09-2014 03:28:38 | Edited 03:28:46] Vegedus-dono~: You act as if that is supposed to be an insult!
[06-09-2014 03:28:41] Calek Albion: what is this sesame street
[06-09-2014 03:28:43] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: [6. september 2014 03:26] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~:

[07-09-2014 02:38:56] Warby-kun~: gurrenfirst
[07-09-2014 02:39:08] Stuff-chan~: it's just jump scares
[07-09-2014 02:39:13] Warby-kun~: mmmmmmm
[07-09-2014 02:39:14] Stuff-chan~: sure that's scary
[07-09-2014 02:39:17] Warby-kun~: not..so much
[07-09-2014 02:39:19] Stuff-chan~: but it's cheap :/
[07-09-2014 02:39:19] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Stuff, I've seen enough enough FNAF
[07-09-2014 02:39:25] Stuff-chan~: IT REALLY IS THOUGH
[07-09-2014 02:39:27] Warby-kun~: it's more of an overwhelming atmosphere
[07-09-2014 02:39:35] Stuff-chan~: IT'S SUSPENSE WATCHING WHERE SHIT IS AND JUMPSCARES
[07-09-2014 02:39:45] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: THE SUSPENSE THOUGH
[07-09-2014 02:39:48] Stuff-chan~: eh
[07-09-2014 02:39:55] Warby-kun~: that's most horror games, Stuff
[07-09-2014 02:40:03] Warby-kun~: suspense and jumpscares
[07-09-2014 02:40:03] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: SUSPENSE
[07-09-2014 02:40:05] Stuff-chan~: nooooooooooooooooo
[07-09-2014 02:40:07] Stuff-chan~: no
[07-09-2014 02:40:16] Stuff-chan~: there's a difference
[07-09-2014 02:40:21] Stuff-chan~: with FNAF
[07-09-2014 02:40:24] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Sus
[07-09-2014 02:40:27] Stuff-chan~: where you KNOW something is gonna appear
[07-09-2014 02:40:41] Stuff-chan~: but with other stuff you're like "FUCKFUYCKWHENISITHAPPENING"
[07-09-2014 02:40:49] Warby-kun~: hmmmm
[07-09-2014 02:40:51 | Edited 02:40:53] Stuff-chan~: I am literally predicting with the audio and shit
[07-09-2014 02:40:57] Stuff-chan~: and there shit is
[07-09-2014 02:41:00] Stuff-chan~: I like
[07-09-2014 02:41:02] Stuff-chan~: for instance
[07-09-2014 02:41:07] Stuff-chan~: the playthroughs of Silent Hills
[07-09-2014 02:41:14] Stuff-chan~: the Norman Reedus one
[07-09-2014 02:41:18] Stuff-chan~: because there are no sounds
[07-09-2014 02:41:20] Warby-kun~: ah yeah
[07-09-2014 02:41:23] Stuff-chan~: you are just walking
[07-09-2014 02:41:25] Warby-kun~: now that you mention it
[07-09-2014 02:41:27] Stuff-chan~: and then BOOM
[07-09-2014 02:41:33] Warby-kun~: there is a distinct difference
[07-09-2014 02:41:39] Stuff-chan~: I AM A HORROR EXPERT I HAVE GROWN UP WITH HORROR MOVIES THAT IS MY FUCKING GENRE
[07-09-2014 02:41:41] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I remember a quote Eli Roth said about horror movies: "Wanna take the horror out of horror movies? Take out the audio."
[07-09-2014 02:41:47] Stuff-chan~: EXACTLY.
[07-09-2014 02:41:55] Warby-kun~: where things in PT just happen without provocation and without you being able to do anything about it
[07-09-2014 02:41:59] Stuff-chan~: it's so much better when you DON'T know
[07-09-2014 02:42:05] Stuff-chan~: EXACTLY.
[07-09-2014 02:42:08] Warby-kun~: whereas FNAF isn't scary if you're playing right
[07-09-2014 02:42:16] Warby-kun~: and it's cheap scares otherwise
[07-09-2014 02:42:17] Stuff-chan~: you can hear everything
[07-09-2014 02:42:19] Stuff-chan~: watch things
[07-09-2014 02:42:22] Stuff-chan~: yadda
[07-09-2014 02:42:24] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I wanna watch a horror movie with you, Stuff u.u
[07-09-2014 02:42:32] Stuff-chan~: Silent Hills is gonna be wonderful
[07-09-2014 02:42:45] Stuff-chan~: I really feel this is gonna get everyone back into horror
[07-09-2014 02:42:52] Stuff-chan~: and the movies changing from stupid gore
[07-09-2014 02:42:56] Stuff-chan~: to actually scary again
[07-09-2014 02:42:59] Warby-kun~: PT is good without the sound because it has the oppressive atmosphere of most horror
[07-09-2014 02:43:28] Stuff-chan~: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv9TTRmT7uQ&list=UUMUzCcUUgkDHvUvzrWMzXmg ;LOLOLOLOLL
[07-09-2014 02:43:44] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: [7. september 2014 02:42] Stuff-chan~: 

<<< I really feel this is gonna get everyone back into horror
and the movies changing from stupid gore
to actually scary againThis is why I really liked The Conjuring. It's a movie that scared me 3 times, which has not happened to me in a long while.
[07-09-2014 02:43:57] Stuff-chan~: OKAY
[07-09-2014 02:43:58] Stuff-chan~: OKAY
[07-09-2014 02:44:02] Stuff-chan~: THE CONJURING
[07-09-2014 02:44:06] Stuff-chan~: I REALLY FUCKING LOVED
[07-09-2014 02:44:06] Stuff-chan~: OKAY
[07-09-2014 02:44:11] Stuff-chan~: BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT
[07-09-2014 02:44:15] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: IT WAS
[07-09-2014 02:44:26] Stuff-chan~: IT WASN'T OVERLY STUPID LIKE OTHER "TRUE STORY" CRAP
[07-09-2014 02:44:32] Stuff-chan~: IT ACTUALLY WAS A SOLID MOVIE
[07-09-2014 02:44:35 | Edited 02:44:36] Stuff-chan~: WITH A GREAT CAST.
[07-09-2014 02:44:58] Warby-kun~: I can't remember the last time horror has scared me
[07-09-2014 02:45:02] Stuff-chan~: THE FAMILY WAS BELIEVEABLE AS WAS THE STORY
[07-09-2014 02:45:06] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: And then they made a spin-off movie to the Annabelle doll -3-'
[07-09-2014 02:45:20] Stuff-chan~: yeah
[07-09-2014 02:45:24] Stuff-chan~: but it's not the true story
[07-09-2014 02:45:26] Stuff-chan~: so I'm sad
[07-09-2014 02:45:32] Stuff-chan~: they're just making a stupid thing up
[07-09-2014 02:45:37] Stuff-chan~: also my only issue with Annabelle
[07-09-2014 02:45:44] Stuff-chan~: is they aren't using the ragdoll
[07-09-2014 02:45:44] Warby-kun~: we should stream horror movies on Halloween
[07-09-2014 02:45:54] Stuff-chan~: because the ragdoll is soooooo much more creepy than the fucking doll they made
[07-09-2014 02:46:03] Stuff-chan~: Warbear have you seen Grave Encounters?
[07-09-2014 02:46:15] Warby-kun~: I did a full review on both of them
[07-09-2014 02:46:45 | Edited 02:47:03] Stuff-chan~: cause, while still predictable, probably is my favorite type of live camera horror movie to come out in a while
[07-09-2014 02:46:50] Stuff-chan~: the second
[07-09-2014 02:46:52] Stuff-chan~: noooooooooooooo

[07-09-2014 02:47:22] Stuff-chan~: I was so disappointed
[07-09-2014 02:47:35] Warby-kun~: they honestly made it into Marble Hornets
[07-09-2014 02:47:44] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: I still think [REC] is the best live camera horror movie

[07-09-2014 05:29:47] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: In other news, Maddox talks about how no one gives a shit when Spider-Man does the poses Spider-Woman is doing in the cover of her new comic.

[07-09-2014 05:40:04] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: which part do you exactly mean?

[07-09-2014 05:44:20] Horyu b-b-aka?!~: he doesn't get that it's wrong Spider-Woman is getting sexualized?

[07-09-2014 05:46:02] Stuff-chan~: but that cover was CLEARLY an oversexualization and disgusting

So how much are you into the whole jack the Ripper thing? I forget
[07-09-2014 22:48:20] Tuor-onii-sama!~: like do you know the names of some of the suspects at the time?

[07-09-2014 23:17:11] Warby-kun~: on a related note; I just murdered the final boss of Dark Souls

[08-09-2014 08:02:18] Hiroko-imouto~: Ahhhhh, wait wait wait. 
Exodis is probably right about Fummo coining specifically "NSFH" or "Not Safe For Horki." I took a closer look and the ones I suggested to Liz were specifically variants of "Horki don't look" or "Horki look away" and stuff.

[08-09-2014 10:32:36] Sefrol-kuuun~: It's up there with it
[08-09-2014 10:33:02] Sefrol-kuuun~: but more spread out since the games can be pretty long with how much text and dialogue there is
[08-09-2014 10:34:47] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Weeeh
[08-09-2014 10:34:51] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Yeah, it's a game
[08-09-2014 10:34:57] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Thought you meant the anime version of it
[08-09-2014 10:35:04] Sefrol-kuuun~: noooooooooooooo?
[08-09-2014 10:35:34] Sefrol-kuuun~: Can't wait for the second series based on the second game to come out though
[08-09-2014 10:35:49] Sefrol-kuuun~: hopefully they'll do a better job with it than the first
[08-09-2014 10:37:53] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: But isn't Dangan Ronpa an anime too? .-.
[08-09-2014 10:38:08] Sefrol-kuuun~: It was first a game
[08-09-2014 10:38:29 | Edited 10:38:39] Sefrol-kuuun~: then it was made into an anime based on the first game
[08-09-2014 10:38:49] Sefrol-kuuun~: and now there's a second game
[08-09-2014 10:39:02] Sefrol-kuuun~: so I'm looking forward to the second rendition of the anime
[08-09-2014 10:40:05] Warby-kun~: even though the first one missed half of the game's content
[08-09-2014 10:41:01] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: Is the game even good?
[08-09-2014 10:41:04] Sefrol-kuuun~: exactly
[08-09-2014 10:41:06] Sefrol-kuuun~: oh yeah
[08-09-2014 10:41:10] Sefrol-kuuun~: game's awesome
[08-09-2014 10:41:30] Sefrol-kuuun~: but it's a mystery game with a lot of point and clicking
[08-09-2014 10:41:40] Warby-kun~: eh
[08-09-2014 10:41:42] Warby-kun~: it's okay
[08-09-2014 10:41:43] Sefrol-kuuun~: You remember, right?
[08-09-2014 10:41:50] Sefrol-kuuun~: I like it
[08-09-2014 10:42:03] Warby-kun~: id rather read the LPs than spend more money on DR, honestly
[08-09-2014 10:42:12] Warby-kun~: rather play 999 or VLR, really
[08-09-2014 10:42:34] Sefrol-kuuun~: Excited for the new game for the series that delves into things outside of the Mutual Killing stories with Naegi's sister
[08-09-2014 10:42:49] Sefrol-kuuun~: I heard of 999, but what's the other?
[08-09-2014 10:43:05] Sefrol-kuuun~: And I kinda just watch the LPs myself
[08-09-2014 10:43:13] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: point and click? Like every computer game? o3o
[08-09-2014 10:43:20] Sefrol-kuuun~: hearing the music and voices feels better than just reading
[08-09-2014 10:43:23] Sefrol-kuuun~: kinda
[08-09-2014 10:44:10] Warby-kun~: Virtue's Last Reward
[08-09-2014 10:44:18] Warby-kun~: sequel to 999
[08-09-2014 10:47:40] Sefrol-kuuun~: oh my
[08-09-2014 10:48:02] Sefrol-kuuun~: I heard 999 had things change up on you with each playthrough so it's always fresh
[08-09-2014 10:51:26] Warby-kun~: mmm. play it if you get the chance. it's pree good.
[08-09-2014 10:51:40] Sefrol-kuuun~: I'd like to
[08-09-2014 10:51:47] Sefrol-kuuun~: It was on the DS, right?
[08-09-2014 10:53:46] Eggs-o'-dis-kun~: games and anime :DD
[08-09-2014 11:01:18] Sefrol-kuuun~: I'm trying to remember if VLS was the game from a while back that every playthrough had random changes to who would be your ally or who'd be your enemy?
[08-09-2014 11:06:48] Sefrol-kuuun~: Or if there were any other similar games released on the handhelds at the time...
[08-09-2014 17:59:39] Hiroko-imouto~: [8. september 2014 10:42] Sefrol-kuuun~:
